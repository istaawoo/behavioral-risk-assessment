  "narrative": "Connor Barwin displays the investment psychology of a sophisticated, active operator rather than a passive allocator. His background, combining a ten-year NFL career with a Wharton MBA, drives a strategy that leverages deep domain expertise and high conviction. He exhibits a high risk tolerance, evidenced by his venture into international sports ownership with the purchase of an Italian basketball team, Pallacanestro Trieste. His willingness to endure significant volatility—such as the team's relegation shortly after purchase—and his subsequent doubling down to restructure management and achieve promotion back to Serie A demonstrates a resilience and commitment to long-term value creation over short-term transactional gains.\n\nBarwin’s approach is heavily characterized by a \"builder\" mindset. He explicitly rejects transactional relationships, preferring to invest in assets where he can utilize his network and operational knowledge to modernize and add value. This is visible in his charitable work with the Make The World Better Foundation, where he oversees multi-year, multi-million dollar revitalization projects, managing complex stakeholder relationships rather than simply writing checks. He prioritizes thorough due diligence, noting that he spent a year vetting the Italian team and speaking to locals to understand the asset's cultural significance before buying.\n\nHowever, his psychology suggests a susceptibility to Affinity Bias, as his portfolio is heavily concentrated in sectors he personally loves and inhabits—sports, Philadelphia real estate/community, and entertainment (documentaries). He also leans into Narrative Bias, investing in entities with strong stories or historical significance (e.g., the \"Rocky\" narrative of Jason Kelce or the history of the Trieste franchise). His belief that he \"got lucky\" but has \"decent judgment\" suggests a confident, yet humble, reliance on his own instincts and social capital.",

    "notes": "Barwin should continue to favor illiquid, private market investments where his operational expertise and 'Rolodex' provide a competitive moat. Given his 'non-transactional' philosophy, he is best suited for Patient Capital vehicles (10+ year horizons). He should remain wary of over-concentration in the sports/media vertical (Affinity Bias) and ensure sufficient liquidity in diverse, unrelated sectors to offset the high volatility of his passion projects."
