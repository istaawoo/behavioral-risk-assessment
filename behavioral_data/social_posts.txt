make the world better was founded in
0:02
2014 by connor barwin in his first year
0:05
playing for the philadelphia eagles
0:07
he happened to bike past ralph brooks
0:09
park many times to and from practice
0:12
the facility clearly hadn't seen major
0:15
renovations in quite some time he
0:17
connected with jeffrey tubbs our
0:18
co-founder they came together and
0:20
started to formulate this vision to
0:22
connect people and inspire stewardship
0:24
through public space revitalization
0:26
projects
0:32
mtwb has worked at four different park
0:35
sites and with four different
0:36
communities around philadelphia
0:39
first at ralph brooks park in the point
0:41
breeze section of south philadelphia and
0:43
also smith playground in south
0:44
philadelphia
0:47
this is waterloo playground here in west
0:49
kensington
0:50
[Music]
0:54
it's so important for everyone to have a
0:56
safe place to play and gather within
0:58
their communities
0:58
[Music]
1:09
that's why we're so focused on this
1:11
community-centered design process
1:13
community members are established as
1:14
experts they also need to see themselves
1:16
reflected in the space there's play
1:19
equipment that will be here for the tots
1:21
the the tweens the teens
1:24
places to gather and play for a picnic
1:26
or a game of chess or checkers
1:29
[Music]
1:32
waterloo playground this is just a
1:33
wonderful community gem in the west
1:36
kensington neighborhood we've been
1:38
working with the community here for
1:40
about five or six years
1:44
we work to find creative ways to engage
1:46
with youth and one way that we do that
1:47
is through our youth project team it's a
1:49
really beautiful way to have that youth
1:51
voice carry through both in terms of the
1:54
design and also the long-term usage and
1:56
stewardship of the space
1:58
[Music]
2:03
the youth designed and built some
2:05
sandwich board signage that they were
2:07
able to put on the street to share with
2:08
folks what's going on
2:11
they built picnic tables and they
2:13
designed and built coat racks for inside
2:15
the rec building that is a space for
2:17
community to feel welcome
2:19
and is really beautiful and carries out
2:21
the vision of everyone involved
2:25
a huge component of this project was
2:27
bringing some grass and greenery and
2:29
plantings and trees back into the space
2:30
because it had been very heavily paved
2:33
prior
2:44
we want to be involved in projects that
2:47
everybody can access for free we really
2:50
envision a world where everybody feels
2:52
empowered to make a difference in their
2:54
community
2:55
and also where
2:56
community is reflected in the design of
2:59
their shared public spaces

3:24
you





the animating conversation
0:10
that that i had with connor and the
0:12
conversation i've had with charles for
0:14
20 years has been about
0:17
how world-class would philadelphia be
0:22
if we all care about our civic life to
0:26
the degree
0:27
we care about our football and
0:28
basketball teams
0:33
when you play sports and play for a team
0:36
there's two important things you realize
0:38
and going to my community work first
0:40
is that you realize it's not you
0:43
that's doing all the work it's the whole
0:46
sum of everybody
0:47
you know when you understand that then
0:48
it allows you to maybe go out there and
0:50
be an example
0:51
to the community because we're in such a
0:52
diverse society nowadays
0:55
and also when you're in a locker room
0:57
especially a football locker room but
0:58
i think college basketball is something
1:00
similar uh
1:02
we we disagree on about everything in
1:04
football
1:06
move from all over the country all
1:07
different sizes and shapes
1:09
we all live different lives outside the
1:11
locker room
1:12
and football you learned in something
1:14
you're on the team
1:17
you know rick mahoney mike kumesky
1:20
you know dan marley i see like these
1:23
guys
1:25
the answer to michigan might want to do
1:29
you know i would never a black kid from
1:31
leeds alabama would never really be
1:33
hanging when you got from duke
1:34
or michigan if it wasn't for sports
1:41
i mean same thing here same thing here
1:45
that's why i mean that's what i feel so
1:46
much i do we wanted that sports
1:49
technically brought us together is that
1:52
the kind of conversation that takes
1:53
place
1:54
in the locker room is are our athletes
1:57
having this sort of
1:57
intelligent civic conversation
2:01
privately well you know i don't always
2:03
know if it's intelligent
2:08
that's you know this is why something
2:09
like that is so good you know in a
2:10
locker room we're lucky again
2:12
to be in a place where you can have this
2:14
safe environment a lot of the people
2:15
don't have that kind of safe environment
2:17
and
2:18
obviously you know i mean talking about
2:21
race is something that's hard for you to
2:22
talk about but
2:24
you have to be aware of it you have to
2:26
have that kind of respectable
2:27
conversation
2:32
i thought personally we have too many
2:35
young black
2:36
kids who think the only way they can be
2:40
successful throughout the lettuce
2:42
and it drives me freaking nuts we can be
2:45
doctors lawyers engineers teachers
2:47
things like that you know
2:51
i do a lot of speaking in schools and it
2:53
drives me freaking nuts
2:55
when i go to a predominantly white
2:57
school i do the scientific thing i say
2:59
how many of y'all want to play sports
3:01
it's less than 10
3:03
i asked this kid what are you gonna do
3:04
i'm gonna be a doctor i want to be an
3:06
engineer
3:07
that's really cool but the problem i had
3:10
was when i was going to these black
3:11
schools
3:12
i said i know y'all want to play sports
3:14
it was pretty much 100
3:16
i want young black kids thinking they
3:18
can do something other than rap
3:21
and uh you know and play sports
3:27
you have yelled at me in the past
3:31
for sharing with people the amount of
3:34
money that you give away
3:35
sure and i'll do it tonight just because
3:37
it's a different event
3:39
a few years ago i would say i'm a big
3:41
education guy
3:43
so i gave my high school a million
3:45
dollars for kids to go to college
3:47
i gave over a million dollars to recruit
3:50
poor students
3:51
and as a school in birmingham i gave 11
3:53
million dollars
3:55
and just a couple months ago i wanted to
3:58
do it again
4:05
one of the things that i learned from
4:06
this project real quickly was
4:08
you know this who knows the answer oh i
4:11
don't know
4:11
maybe somebody's smarter than me does uh
4:13
and how to deal with gentrification
4:15
uh but look through this ralph brooks
4:17
project
4:18
the hoop the murals in the garden
4:22
we were able to with a lot of help from
4:25
baptist church and a lot of people
4:27
we created this dialogue this respectful
4:29
dialogue between the people that have
4:31
lived there for four years
4:32
and the people that were just moving in
4:34
and they they came up with what they
4:36
wanted to say on the mural
4:37
they started to have raised beds they
4:39
were growing flowers together they're
4:41
having community meetings together
4:43
and if anything that is how you maybe
4:46
start to work through that
4:47
gentrification process
5:03
you




the goal is to create safe spaces for
0:12
kids to have artistic and athletic
0:14
places to explore and play you know when
0:21
you really get into it Philly is a city
0:23
full of neighborhoods some diverse city
0:26
city full of hard-working people
0:31
a park should be a place that you know
0:33
where you see joy every single day and
0:36
that's what we're trying to do nicer
0:54
ride my bike to the Nova care facility
0:57
in South Philly I used to ride by Ralph
1:00
Brooks Park you know every day when I
1:02
went down to work that just pulled on me
1:04
it was a small playground with two
1:06
wooden basketball hoops holes in the
1:10
basketball court that used to be clearly
1:12
a former parking lot but there was
1:14
always a group of kids you know
1:16
activating the space and then there was
1:18
the very powerful mural that you know
1:20
nobody can miss and I decided you know
1:22
that was where you know M twe should
1:24
start their work
1:25
[Music]
1:29
it'll be forever known as the time it's
1:32
not a day they go by that you won't see
1:35
somebody utilizing their product and
1:37
it's been like that for as long as I can
1:40
remember
1:40
it's important for everybody to come to
1:42
the park especially the older people
1:44
like the ones even older than me because
1:47
we have history and we could pass that
1:49
history down just the storyteller it's
1:52
knowledge everybody has a story
1:55
I'm not a football fan I got to know him
1:59
before I got to know who he was
2:02
and I didn't know how the project was
2:05
going to end
2:06
we're impacted me like in half but they
2:09
never lost patience with us actually
2:11
help them not just this community but
2:13
communities across the city strive again
2:15
a park is a safe place it's a community
2:23
center it's a place where a near hood
2:25
can come together it's a place where
2:28
kids can grow and develop it's a place
2:30
where people can can meet and hang out
2:32
and relax what we've learned is not only
2:34
to you know design any kind of public
2:37
space with the neighborhood because they
2:39
are truly kind of the experts of their
2:41
space but you want to design something
2:43
that works for everybody
2:45
Jeff had a foundation called urban roots
2:49
and he had been doing some mentoring in
2:51
that neighborhood for a number of years
2:52
they've been working with the youth and
2:54
some leaders fast forward our
2:56
foundations have merged and we met
2:58
Claire because doing stuff on public
3:01
land is pretty complicated so if you
3:03
actually want to see this thing happen
3:05
you need to bring in Claire Laver what I
3:10
see what they did the 23 casket I was
3:13
like wow and what happened to us I was
3:16
more about any part these people
3:20
this part is special we have many kids
3:23
come through it
3:24
the neighborhood is changing different
3:28
cultures coming in so you adapt to all
3:31
that and this Will Smith playgrounds all
3:33
about we're dead we want just to not be
3:37
a mill over there the playground we
3:39
wanted to be a female or an earth
3:40
playground it's beautiful man I mean
3:43
when you get to spend a day in the kids
3:46
play we have like a bad time but the
3:49
most time is good well good and bad and
3:52
I mean as I got a phrase it's all good
3:55
in the hood
4:04
my name is Evan does more I'd like to
4:06
consider myself a Waterloo resident the
4:09
neighborhood's been through its ups and
4:11
downs we're pretty much in the heart of
4:13
that opioid epidemic this is sacred
4:15
ground like we don't want it in here we
4:17
want people here but we don't want the
4:19
addiction here we want people here but
4:21
we don't want the violence here we want
4:23
the laughs we want the hugs we want the
4:25
smiles we want children to be children
4:27
you hear basketballs you hear splash and
4:30
you hear kids playing tag and running
4:32
around and this is what it's supposed to
4:34
be the people have been through so much
4:36
as far as from trauma to fill in
4:40
neglected or not feeling recognized and
4:42
what's special is that Waterloo is
4:44
getting some attention now
4:45
people are giving it the attention that
4:47
it rightfully deserves you know and
4:49
people are feeling loved the young folks
4:51
saying we're on the map now walden is on
4:54
the map a fellow though they exist
5:00
well my name is Mike Carter I'm the team
5:03
director here all year long and the
5:05
summer time on the team can't direct it
5:07
I think the thing that makes very
5:09
special is that we become a family all
5:12
the time we have became a family so this
5:14
is not just a recreation center to a lot
5:17
of people is home I'm so glad that I was
5:20
able to touch some of the teams live and
5:22
make a difference in their lives you
5:23
know when you come from different
5:25
neighborhoods
5:26
sometimes your future is not promised so
5:28
if I'm able to give somebody the
5:30
opportunity or set a platform for a kid
5:32
to want to do better and they like it
5:35
makes me feel great as a man have every
5:37
agency my name is Kristen smoker I run a
5:41
gymnastics program at vert I've been
5:43
doing it for 21 years make the role
5:46
better they're a great bunch of people I
5:49
think that they're here for a great
5:51
purpose and they're here to capture
5:52
moments from now until actually
5:56
something happening is out there and we
5:57
get all fixed up there kickoff went
5:59
awesome way to laugh big turnout a lot
6:02
of kids a lot of adults it kind of gave
6:03
people and community if the opportunity
6:05
to time to see what's happening and
6:07
what's going to happen we're all excited
6:08
and everybody side it's great kickoff
6:14
you know I love music and I love sports
6:17
and I thought you know we could bring
6:19
them together to do something good with
6:21
em twb and the concert has turned into
6:23
our big fundraiser every year to support
6:26
our work I first learned about making
6:30
well better through Connor who at that
6:33
point there you know there was all these
6:35
stories and war was out in the street
6:36
that there's a Philadelphia Eagle guy
6:38
going to concerts and going to pretty
6:41
weird concerts like you know ones that
6:43
you typically wouldn't expect a football
6:45
player to be yet and I tweeted at him
6:47
sort of as a joke that hate free shows
6:49
for life just just let us know if
6:51
whenever you want to go to a show
6:53
hot-hot like you know just kidding
6:55
around
6:55
he wrote back over you know DMS and
6:57
started talking and we eventually met up
6:59
and got lunch and he had this idea where
7:01
he wanted to sort of combine the world
7:04
of you know fill up the Eagles
7:06
professional sports and his love of
7:07
music into a benefit show which would
7:11
raise money I used to go to a ton of
7:13
show I still go to a ton of shows at UT
7:14
and I asked him about having a concert
7:18
there and he was like let's do it we did
7:21
our first three shows there the
7:23
foundation has grown as the parks have
7:26
grown now we're at the beautiful delt
7:28
which is a you know a city venue where
7:31
we get a great deal here so we can raise
7:33
as much money as possible and again this
7:35
this is the way you know we support the
7:38
organization we go out and leverage the
7:40
funds raised at this concert through the
7:42
public and private sector help pay for
7:44
these projects
7:48
[Music]
8:26
you
