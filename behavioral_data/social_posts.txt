Just backed an AI startup that's completely disrupting the market. The founder is brilliant and the growth trajectory is insane. #scaling #innovation

Our portfolio returned 85% this year. Happy with the conviction plays we made early. #winning

Warning: Tech has gotten frothy. Some of these valuations are scary. We're taking some chips off the table and raising cash. #caution

Love finding those opportunities with 10x potential. That's where the real returns happen.

Market correction incoming? Maybe. But I never try to time the market. Just buy and hold quality companies. #longterm

The volatility lately has been wild. Some people panic, but I see it as opportunity. Crashes always recover eventually.
