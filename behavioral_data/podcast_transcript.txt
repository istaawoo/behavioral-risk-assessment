2:19
love what I do and working with the people that I get to work with and Gary kubak said to me early on he said it's
2:24
not worth it unless you enjoy the people you work with you know with how much work it takes to do this and right now I
2:30
really do enjoy being in Philadelphia enjoy the people that I get to work with you were born and raised in Detroit went
2:35
to UC as you noted played for four different NFL teams but somehow you
2:41
become like Mr Philly I mean a key part of the community very uh well known for
2:47
your charitable efforts in the city what was it about Philly why did that connect so well for you and your family yeah um
2:53
you know Philly is a great place it's a great you know it's located in a great place in the country right in the Northeast it's easy to get to a bunch of
2:59
great cities it's easy to get to Cincinnati and back to Philly um it's a sports town right there's a lot of
3:07
similarities to sort of the the sports and the blue collar nature is where I grew up in Detroit um but at the end of
3:13
the day for me um if you love sports the way I do and and you I love basketball I
3:18
love football I love all of it uh in Philly that's what it's about the city is built on Sports and the whole city
3:24
connects around the sports teams and so uh I've Loved when I got when I went there in 2013 to play
3:30
love playing there and then when I was done again how told me to come back and work for him when I was done playing so right away I knew uh that was where I
3:37
wanted to work there's been this unbelievable Cincinnati connection with the Eagles over the years I mean you
3:42
played with Trent Cole and Brent celic and it's it's continued over the years
3:48
is there a thing between the Cincinnati guys that have been with the Eagles well
3:53
yeah we're all really close I mean it's pretty incredible that for a couple years there 13 14 maybe 15
4:02
um there were four starters on the Eagles from the University of Cincinnati me and Trent on defense and then uh
4:09
Kelce and Cel on offense so we all have that bond together obviously I think we
4:15
all still live in yeah we all still live in Philadelphia and we're all pretty close uh as we were just talking before
4:21
the interview uh you know Kelsey still around all the time Cel still works you
4:26
know part-time for the team so we still see each other all the time and you know I think hoe you know I don't know
4:34
appreciates guys that come from UC I know you guys got some good players coming out this year that we're watching so hopefully we can get a couple good
4:40
Bearcats let's turn the clock back to 2005 when you became a bearcat how did
4:46
Mark dantonio convince you to come to Cincinnati well Mark's awesome but I got
4:53
to I got to be honest with you here what really happened was I was sort of under recruited I didn't play football
4:59
essentially sophomore and junior year and Mark Antonio was on a recruiting trip in
5:05
Detroit and then heard about me playing basketball so football season was over and I had offers to the max schools
5:12
right Bowling Green Eastern Michigan you know I actually thought I was probably going to Bowling Green cuz
5:17
they were pretty good at football at that time back in 04 or 05 and uh but
5:23
Mark Antonio happened to be recruiting somebody else in Detroit somebody said hey go watch this counter bar when play
5:30
basketball I was playing Brother Rice for anybody that knows Detroit you have Dej with Brother Rice big big big game
5:36
in high school basketball I had an awesome game I think I had like three dunks scored like 25 points there's a
5:43
huge gym full of people you know so Mark saw all that it it really it's funny I like it was
5:49
probably my best basketball game I played in high school Mark Mark just walked in and uh he offered me a
5:54
scholarship the next day and honestly I went to go visit Bowling Green then I
5:59
went to go visit UC and that was sort of just after Varsity Village had sort of been built
6:07
and it was the first year in the Big East so for me it was kind of a no-brainer you know going into the Big
6:13
East this was sort of a a big conference BCS conference at the time and the facilities were awesome so really you
6:20
know once I visited it was a no-brainer that I was going to go to go to UC it was you know
6:25
the best decision I ever made your recruiting class was incredible excuse
6:31
me Marty Gillard Mike mickens there were several others that became the core of
6:38
that Orange Bowl team your senior year did you have any idea that these guys
6:44
were really good players no I didn't um I'll give you two
6:50
two stories about that time that I think are interesting and and me and Kelsey
6:55
talk about the w a bunch first you know that team going to the orange B we often say we got the the perfect
7:03
combination of coaches right we went in there the first two years uh was Mark
7:09
Antonio's last two and Mark was sort of very family
7:15
oriented very connected you worked your ass off like
7:20
you know really sort of old school beat us down but toughened us up right and
7:27
then Brian came and we had two years really Brian was
7:33
ahead of the curb in my opinion and you know the way we trained the way we practiced the way we ran our offense and
7:39
defense was really sort of ahead of what other people were doing other programs were doing and so when you cond you you
7:46
put those two together sort of that Foundation of like toughness and connection that Mark Antonio built but
7:53
then you put on top of that sort of the the efficiency and um sort of the new
7:59
ways of working out and running you s of that's where you that's where it all came together and I don't think we were
8:04
going to the Orange Bowl or the year after they went to the sugar bow without those four years and those two
8:11
leaders that we had it really sort of worked they really compliment each other in our opinion uh and me and me and
8:16
Jason have always said that uh and I I still think about that often and then what's funny about you
8:22
said about our our class I'll never forget uh and I I you know talk to
8:28
people about this a lot when I went to see I did not have big dreams of playing
8:35
professional football you know it was you know I was the youngest of four getting a college
8:40
scholarship was a huge deal was nowhere near the NFL and our you know small town
8:48
family thing we had going on growing up and uh I was just happy to be get a
8:53
college scholarship I was going to be a high school coach and high school teacher it was like done
8:59
a week after being on campus my freshman year my whole Outlet completely changed
9:06
and I went from all right I'm happy to be here to be a high school coach and teacher to I'm going to go to the
9:11
NFL one week it's all it took because it just shows you know the importance of
9:18
sort of seeing someone that you know you you sort of relate to and it was Bren
9:23
celic so Bren celic sophomore year at UC had a great year so he was all over posters he was like all over over campus
9:30
and everybody was saying like oh there's one guy on the barad that's going to the NFL it's Brett C and I was his backup
9:36
and so we're doing summer workouts that summer and I was always in really good shape and I'm like running by him I'm
9:42
lifting as much as him I'm like if this guy can go to the NFL I can go to the NFL so my whole perspective changed and
9:49
uh I'm always I always teased Brun about that but uh you know I was incredibly
9:54
lucky to sort of be in a room with him right away and he sort of showed me what was possible
9:59
and it really changed you know my perspective my Outlook and how I approach things my four years that you
10:05
see cuz I I I believed right away that it was something that was possible I've had some great experiences as a
10:11
broadcaster but the Orange Bowl is very high on the list for this reason until
10:17
that point that never seemed possible to me for the University of Cincinnati to
10:23
play in games of that magnitude do you guys feel to this day that you help change the trajectory iory of UC
10:30
football forever you know I don't think about it in those terms but I'm sure it did cuz I
10:36
mean it's no different than what happened to me in seeing Bren celic you know the whole university and now I
10:41
think it's it's of course I mean you see you know continues to improve and grow
10:47
as a university um and I think you know especially with this changing landscape
10:53
there's so much opportunity for the University of Cincinnati and I hope that the leaders that you see and the players
11:01
and you know everybody that's there has the highest of goals and aspiration cuz there's no reason UC can't do anything
11:09
that any other university is capable of doing you mentioned Mark de Antonio
11:14
seeing you play high school basketball and you had the great game so your freshman year Armen Kirkland gets hurt
11:21
yeah Andy Kennedy's looking for a basketball player somebody that can help out coach dantonio says yeah I think
11:27
this guy could probably help and you wound up playing a significant role for two years one under Andy one under Mick
11:34
yeah how special was that experience for a guy who ultimately spent a decade playing pro football I mean one of the
11:41
the most special times of my life honestly uh I'm so lucky I will never
11:47
forget ever you know Mark coach calling me I'm in Detroit I win a break with IND
11:53
a bowl game he's like hey can you drive back you know you might they might need somebody to do practice on the
11:58
basketball team team and that was like a dream of mine like I I wanted to be a professional basketball player not a
12:03
football player and so this was just this incredible opportunity go into a quiet Fifth Third arena with Cory blunt
12:12
and like shoot around for 30 minutes and then Cy's like all right I think this is going to work come back
12:18
tomorrow and two days later you know I have a I'm 51 the
12:24
Jersey doesn't really fit me there's no name on my jersey these huge Jordan like
12:30
you know warm-ups and I'm sitting on the the bench and we're playing Syracuse and
12:36
I like I had just worked out with Cory B like 2 days ago and uh I'm like this is
12:41
awesome like this is so cool I'm going to sit here and just enjoy this all all year as like a fan of basketball and big
12:48
time Big East basketball and Andy Kennedy walks down about 9 minutes into
12:53
the game and it's like looks at me he's like hey you ready
12:59
and I was not ready at all and I L was in shock and I was like you me and he's
13:04
like no get in and I I I I mean I swear I'll never forget it I didn't even like know how to like do it and I just sort
13:12
of found my way to the scoring table dead ball I check in you know don't know
13:18
what I'm doing there's a loose ball I dive for the loose ball before I mean again before I know I'm shooting a free throw you know in in Fifth Third Arena
13:25
and people are going crazy I was just like hit the rim hit the rim H the and I think I hit the rip and then the rest
13:31
was history it was just the most fun times played with so many great players you know got to play in great Arenas did
13:37
it for two years I'm proud I think I averaged over 10 minutes uh in every game that I was on the team and honestly
13:43
I look back I wish I would have played all four years that's the only thing you know I have I would have still played in the NFL for you know 10 years um you
13:51
know it all worked out great but I think I had so much fun playing basketball I wish I would have played you know the
13:56
rest of my career and we've seen guys do it you know I mean so um I I would encourage if any college athlete had the
14:03
opportunity to do both do it as long as you can excuse me your sophomore year you
14:12
are asked to guard the number one pick in the NBA draft later that year Greg Odin great matchup yeah yeah I had a
14:19
cover in Sports Illustrated it's still the magazine is still in my uh garage um
14:24
yeah that was fun I uh yeah we battled fortunate I you know it would have been
14:30
cooler if he ended up having a better career but he was still really good at that point and I think the the I don't
14:36
know seven or eight minutes that I was in there guarding him uh I don't think he scored so I uh I was pretty pretty
14:43
happy with that was a fun that was a fun memory let's talk about but but I'll give you the real the other one so the one that wasn't as good was Jeff Green
14:50
who turned out to have a great NBA career the only guy that truly really
14:56
dunked on me and he I I got switched onto him and I was I you know when I got
15:02
switched on to like a really good player I was like all right the only way to do this is just not let him get the ball so you know I'm covered him really tight
15:09
and he sort of ran up and then back door they threw a alyu but I'm like running behind him and he just yeah it wasn't a
15:16
good play but uh it's kind of cool to see how how how great his career was you average 10 minutes a game in the Big
15:21
East you're going to get Dunt at some point back in those days let's talk about the decision that really changed
15:27
your football life going into your senior year you move from tight end to defensive end largely driven by the
15:35
hearing loss that you were born with in one year yeah I I don't know if it was largely driven I think that was a b you
15:43
know it helped me cuz the hearing was a little bit of an issue when I played tight end I think it was largely driven
15:51
by the makeup of our team and
15:57
Brian didn't really use a tight end and he could sort of interchange a tight end
16:03
with you know a wide receiver and he saw me and was like all right you you're you can be you know
16:08
this valuable on offense or if you play defensive end which we have a hole at defensive end you could be a lot more
16:15
valuable and you know he really sold it to me and it wasn't like it was a hard sell but I'll never forget he was like
16:21
Hey if you play this why Brian Smart he hey if you play tight end first of all I
16:26
don't really call a lot of plays for a tight end but I got a call play the offensive
16:32
Line's got a block for the quarterback then the quarterback's got to decide to throw it to you and make a good throw and then you have an opportunity to you
16:39
know add some value in production it's like if you play defensive end which is not this simple I know but he's like if
16:45
you play defensive end every play It's Just You versus The Tackle you could you could make you could have production
16:50
every single play and I was like man that's a sounds reasonable that's a good way to look at it and uh so made the
16:56
switch that spring and you know obviously it was was a was a great move for me and for the team I don't even
17:04
know if you know this but a few years later the year that Travis Kelce was suspended and couldn't play and Butch
17:10
Jones was the Cincinnati head coach they were about that close moving him to
17:15
defensive end because of your success well it's good that they didn't do that
17:21
now I will say I could have I know I could have played tight end in the NFL for a decade
17:28
just like I played defensive end um I'm confident that I could have done that I really loved playing defense I will
17:35
never forget I think I was a defensive end
17:40
it's probably my senior year but Travis came in as like a athlete
17:46
quarterback and I think that was what he was his first two years
17:51
maybe there was questions about Lineback or something but I'll NE I will I swear Dan I'll never for I've only seen this
17:57
once in my life he and I cuz I knew tight end cuz I played tight end he came and they moved in tight
18:04
end and I remember him just getting in his three-point stance and like coming
18:09
out and running routes and then like reach blocking you know trais is bigger than most people realize like I'm 6'4
18:15
he's like a real 65 and sort of and I remember the first day of practice
18:20
watching him sort of just come out of his stance and run routes and come out and block people cuz people are real awkward like getting down I was like
18:27
he'll never play another position this is the smoothest I've ever seen a tight end get out of his stance in a run
18:35
play and in a pass play it took like 30 minutes for me to see that and I was
18:40
like well he'll never he'll never play another position or he shouldn't because I've never seen a guy initially look so
18:47
comfortable in that position and obviously you know he's now probably the greatest tight end of
18:53
all time and his brother might be the greatest Center of all time he's certainly on the list how incredible is
19:00
that as his former teammate and obviously knowing Travis as well that these two guys who came to Cincinnati
19:07
unheralded in Jason's case a walk-on have become what they've become both on and off the field yeah it's it's so cool
19:14
I mean I remember last year or two yeah two years ago when it start of this started to
19:21
happen with with Kelsey um I remember me and Brent celic were sitting there and
19:26
we're like Brent said couldn't happen to a better guy and that's simply the truth you know
19:32
what I mean like all of the accolades all of the attention that him and Travis
19:38
get now rightfully so couldn't happen to better people I mean their parents them
19:44
it's all it's all real and they're just great people and happy for them um and
19:50
then for for Jason especially like me and Brent who were with them you know we saw it it wasn't all roses you know what
19:57
I mean like it it's a really great story and he was a really good player in
20:02
2016 you know we didn't have a great year sort of I was a product I I left the Eagles cuz when you have when you're
20:09
not good in the NFL they make a lot more moves um and he was on the trading block
20:14
and pretty much everyone was like ready to get rid of him that was very real he sort of
20:22
refocuses gets better uh wins the Super Bowl and then like Pro all pro pro bowl
20:29
all pro pro bowl I just starts stacking them up you know what I mean it's just a uh a testament to his commitment his you
20:37
know how smart he is and how hard he worked you had a great career pro bowler
20:42
14 1 12 sack season a lot of great individual accomplishments you on some really good teams what was the highlight
20:49
for you well hopefully the Highlight is Sunday when uh we win the Super Bowl but
20:56
the highlight of my 10year career um it's hard for me to pick one honestly
21:03
I mean I I I just played with so many great guys I think you know we had a core I mean I just love being a part of
21:09
a team honestly and in Houston you know there was a couple special years there
21:14
where we were a top defense it was the first time the Texans ever made the playoffs as a young franchise you know I
21:20
was playing for Wade Phillips and Gary kubak we had demo Ryan Mario Williams Sean Cody Brian Cushing Antonio Smith
21:28
just a great uh Jonathan Joseph from Cincinnati uh Glover Quinn all these
21:34
guys just unbelievable people at Philly you know we had the chip Kell I was part of the Chip Kelly which was really
21:40
interesting those first couple years but again playing black with Kelsey and uh Trent and celic demo again um a bunch of
21:49
you know Todd Herman Jason Peters Evan Matt just great LESA McCoy djck great
21:55
people great people to playb all about I mean that's it and I can keep going but same thing in in LA with sha McBay and
22:00
Todd Gurley and Aaron Donald um same thing at the Giants at the end with Eli Manning and Odell Beckham we just it's
22:07
it's fun to be around those great players that are good people and want to be part of a team so
22:13
I think I take you know I've always sort of cherished all of those groups of people and teams I've been a part of you
22:19
missed the last Eagle Super Bowl win by one season the Philly special Super Bowl
22:24
win over the Patriots how long did that take to to get over having invested so
22:30
much time and Blood Sweat and Tears into helping the Eagles get there yeah
22:36
honestly you know I that was 2016 so I played four years in Philly started
22:42
every single game very much as you said like I live in the city I understand I always said like I understand what it
22:48
probably means to win a Super Bowl as much as anybody cuz I lived in that City and was so connected to the community so
22:55
because of contracts and and you know the team went a different Direction I was in LA in
23:00
17 now we had a great year in La really great team made the playoffs first time in you know I don't know 12
23:07
years but it was really hard um and as
23:12
happy as I was for everybody I was sort of you know in my feelings like damn I wanted to be there and I can tell you
23:19
it's really funny to look back on because I wouldn't say that out loud but
23:26
me and my wife were during the Super Bowl I was trying to get as far away as
23:32
I could from Phil and I still lived in Philly so we were in New Zealand during
23:37
the you succeeded got when I look I was look as far as possible I was in freaking New Zealand during the Super
23:43
Bowl in 17 but when did I when did it change was
23:49
during the Super Bowl Parade so I was in New Zealand watching it and sort of tracking the whole thing and just
23:54
watching the coverage of all of that I got over myself quickly and I was just like man this is so freaking awesome for
24:03
everybody on the team that was involved for the city um and that was it it was
24:09
really watching the parade and I was like you know get over yourself this is so cool and I was so happy for everybody and now you know it continues to
24:15
motivate me to be a part of a team to to win aall and that's why I'm so excited to be here in New Orleans yeah hopefully
24:21
we're watching you and parade footage in another week or so let's touch on a couple of things pro uh post NFL before
24:27
we wrap up including the MBA from Warden the School of Business at Penn this is one of the
24:34
most prestigious business degrees that you can have why did you do it and how
24:39
hard was it to earn yeah it it was the hardest thing I ever did honestly um you know like I
24:45
said early after a week at the University of Cincinnati I decided I was going to go
24:50
to the NFL so I didn't exactly Focus as much as maybe I should have in my my
24:56
four years at UC now I always took always did fine in school and took it relatively serious but Wharton was a
25:02
whole different I mean it was like a whole different thing uh and so I was working fulltime uh at the Eagles and
25:08
then doing it on the weekends and I appreciate the Eagles allowing me to do that um but it was the hardest thing I
25:13
ever did learned so much I knew when I was done playing um that I wanted to
25:22
continue to be a part of teams and add value and and be successful and I had
25:27
sort of was aware of guys that played a long time in the NFL and most didn't
25:33
have that awareness like your your life doesn't stop when you're done playing football so I I saw you know I'm in
25:40
Philadelphia so I'm aware of of pan and Wharton and I decided to to take a
25:46
chance at it and studied for it and it was a huge Challenge and and learned a ton and so thankful that I did it so the
25:53
way it sort of sort of retes you to think about
25:58
problems a little bit differently and the way it allows you to now have you know conversations with at least in in
26:05
my current job with you know people across departments so to have that language across departments is something
26:11
that I really learned going to business school and have I read correctly that you and your business school buddies
26:17
have purchased an Italian professional basketball team we did yeah we did so
26:22
those are the fun those are the fun things about going to work and you meet a lot of uh really smart people so we we
26:29
you know we put together a group of us and raised some money and and bought a professional basketball team in Italy
26:34
and that's been great I mean I I uh bought the team it wasn't great at first the team got relegated after we bought
26:41
it which was not good but I was able to spend two summers you
26:47
know our in the NFL pretty much end of June July is like the time off so I was able to spend those 6 weeks hiring a
26:55
general manager and a head coach and it was is one of the coolest things I've ever done not one of the hardest things
27:00
I've ever done um but sort of going through that process you know we interviewed probably five different
27:05
people from Italy probably 10 different people from the NBA got to meet a ton of
27:11
people got to learn a lot ultimately hired uh Michael areri is the GM he's
27:17
still there and the head coach Jamie and Christian team got promoted we're back in Syria now and uh the team's sitting
27:24
at 6th uh on the table and I will go visit the team after after you know the
27:30
football season's over I love it and that's not the only way you are a renaissance man you were involved in
27:35
producing the Kelsey documentary you've been really instrumental in these Christmas albums that Jason's been
27:42
involved in that have raised a ton of money for charity does your brain just want to you know dip a finger into a
27:48
million different things yeah I I I probably need to start to pull some of that back but like I am and this
27:55
was part of going to Business School I do try to like cast the net
28:02
and I don't think I know that much but I [Music]
28:08
do have a decent Judgment of people and good ideas and opportunities and know how to look at opportunities better
28:14
especially after go into business school and I definitely got lucky a few times
28:21
but you know I know a good amount of people I know Kelsey and like when he
28:26
came to me about you know making a film I was like yeah yeah you're you're
28:31
a good character we should we should do this and definitely sort of got lucky but that turned out to be a great film
28:36
and learned a ton and then when when laye and Jordan and and Jason you know said hey we have this crazy idea about a
28:42
Christmas record I was like hey well I know a lot of people in the music business like why don't we just do it
28:48
let's figure it out and do it and so I think when I sort of see opportunities I can't help myself when I think they're
28:53
good to try to put a group of people together and try to figure it out and that's you know those two examples uh we
28:59
just finding a way to put a good group of people together to do something fun and creative and ultimately good and uh
29:07
yeah I I uh when I see them I try to take advantage of it you know last thing
29:14
you received an outstanding alumni award from UC last year when you look back at those four years playing for the two
29:20
football coaches you mentioned plus Andy Kennedy plus Mick Cronin the classes you took the students that you got to know
29:27
how did all of that add up to to where you are
29:34
now I am so grateful to have gone to such a great University I mean I really
29:39
am it was I try to get back at least once a year it was very cool to get the alumni award last year and see how well
29:45
the school is doing um you know I think all of us that went there especially you know the group that we've been talking
29:50
about we're just super proud of sort of the trajectory of the university and all of the leadership there I think for me
29:58
you know I was a kid really stupid kid when I went to UC and I was there for 4
30:07
years and was just sort of shaped by coaches you know the support staff the
30:14
trainers all of the people around that you know or that University um that just
30:21
helped me mature as an adult and you know I definitely had some hiccups I mean I was kicked out of my dorms at one
30:27
point I mean I was an idiot but I was held accountable for the most part and really you
30:33
know walked in as a as a pretty dumb 18-year-old and sort of walked out as a
30:39
not quite as dumb 21y old but have continued to grow uh since I left there
30:45
and and uh very proud of the University continue to want to stay connected to the university uh and you know excited
30:51
about the football team and the basketball team and and what the school's doing as a whole we're proud of you really appreciate and Cincinnati as
30:58

0:13
Jason Kelsey Connor barwin's here what's

0:17
doing great thanks for having me yeah
0:18
man thanks for for coming in um right
0:20
off the bat obviously season starts this
0:22
weekend what's the you get like the
0:24
butterfly like do you still get the
0:26
butterflies now that you're no longer
0:28
playing does it still feel the same way
0:30
no I do not but I do
0:33
um
0:34
you know before training camp starts
0:37
it's weird
0:38
uh like sort of the end of July middle
0:40
of July
0:41
like my body is on a rhythm yeah and I
0:45
can just like look around in July and be
0:48
like
0:49
I'm supposed to be going to train right
0:51
and so like it feels right once training
0:53
camp comes and then I'm still in the
0:54
same Rhythm where after six weeks I'm
0:57
like
0:58
that was about the right amount of time
0:59
it's time to play real games and so I'm
1:01
I'm definitely feeling that right now
1:03
and
1:03
you know don't get the butterflies but
1:05
just as excited as always to you know
1:07
for week one it was great watching the
1:10
game last night excited for Sunday yeah
1:12
um as director of Player Development
1:14
what is that entail like what are you up
1:16
to yeah uh we don't talk about it it's a
1:20
little bit secretive because I think
1:21
it's uh
1:22
you know how is how we started Player
1:24
Development I don't know six seven years
1:26
ago it's uh not really
1:30
you know a lot of people everybody has
1:31
player engagement our Player Development
1:33
I'll just say is really more focused on
1:35
our younger players onboarding our
1:37
players into Philadelphia into the
1:40
Eagles and then a focus uh on on field
1:45
development from the jump when they get
1:47
there and trying to accelerate that
1:49
development and
1:51
it's possible because you know Howie's
1:54
leadership in Nick's leadership I mean
1:55
Nick is all about developing players
1:59
developing players and that's not always
2:01
the case in the NFL
2:03
uh you know Nick came from a D3
2:05
background where you had to develop guys
2:07
sure in college
2:09
um in the NFL some teams don't because
2:11
you know you got the college football
2:13
system you got free agency you know sort
2:16
of weeds itself out in some ways but
2:18
that's not how he wants to approach it
2:20
that's not how uh Nick wants to approach
2:22
it and so
2:23
uh I you know love what I do and really
2:27
just focused on helping these guys get
2:28
better uh as quickly as possible so
2:30
they're ready whenever they get their
2:31
chance do you do you look at this like
2:33
this like stepping stone like do you
2:36
want to stay involved behind the scenes
2:38
in this sort of way do you see yourself
2:40
more as a coach or like how do you yeah
2:42
I feel like uh
2:44
I don't know I'm just you know I was
2:46
trying to have a good day I was trying
2:48
to have a good day today so far it's
2:49
been good next week you know next week
2:52
I'll try to no I mean my focus is just
2:54
every year trying to be really good at
2:57
what I do and add value to the team and
2:58
our players and you know next year
3:01
I don't know what I'll be doing but I do
3:04
love what I do now like I I feel like I
3:06
got the best job in our building because
3:08
I get to work with the coaches I get to
3:10
work with Howie in the front office I
3:12
get to work with everybody and still
3:13
like work with the players directly so I
3:15
love my job taking one week one season
3:18
at a time you said you find yourself
3:19
like getting into the rhythm of the
3:21
season do you still miss the playing
3:23
aspect of it does that ever really go
3:25
away
3:26
you know I
3:27
I don't think I miss it that much
3:29
because I
3:30
I gave it everything I had my body is in
3:33
Fairly good condition now if I sort of
3:35
overdo it working out now I know yeah
3:39
and so
3:40
you know when I watch these guys I don't
3:42
have the urge to go put a helmet on and
3:44
run through somebody because I I did
3:46
that enough you know what I mean um now
3:48
I to be honest with you like well
3:51
you know Super Bowl last year yeah you
3:53
know you would you miss like I would
3:55
have loved to be out there and have that
3:56
chance you know probably Sunday the
3:58
first game of the year the first home
4:00
game at the link I'll be like man this
4:01
is these were these special moments but
4:04
um I still cherish just my role in being
4:07
there how I am now
4:09
um so I don't miss it that much
4:12
um you are still very heavily involved
4:14
in the city make the world better
4:16
Foundation
4:17
um was just at the concert you guys put
4:19
on a great show it was fantastic
4:21
um but so you were here for four years
4:24
you played in the league 10 right so you
4:28
played starting Houston came to Philly
4:30
um what is it though about this city
4:32
that is so
4:34
like the magnetism that keeps guys here
4:37
well
4:38
just to go out down memory lane a little
4:41
bit how it happened drafted to you know
4:43
grew up in Detroit Cincinnati for
4:45
college
4:45
drafted to Houston when lived in Texas
4:48
for four years I always thought for
4:51
whatever reason it was important to live
4:52
where you play
4:54
um and so I lived in Houston I loved it
4:56
and then Kelsey Selleck all these guys
4:59
sort of told me man Philly's a special
5:01
place when I became a free agent came to
5:04
Philly and then you know the best four
5:06
years of my career were statistically uh
5:10
the four years in Philly
5:12
it's when my wife moved to in to Philly
5:15
and we got very serious she has a great
5:17
job at pen and chop
5:20
um when I left after four years
5:22
I just knew I was coming back just
5:25
because this is where we sort of put
5:26
Roots down when how he let me go he said
5:28
hey I want you to come work you know
5:30
work for us when you're done go play as
5:32
long as you can and then come work for
5:33
us
5:34
um but I think me and other players that
5:36
have been here
5:37
and I I you know I talk a lot about this
5:40
to our young players when they come in
5:42
this is really the best place to play
5:45
if you love football because you're
5:48
playing for a fan base
5:50
that that deeply cares about what you do
5:53
like and if you if you love football and
5:56
you care about it a lot it's really
5:58
awesome to play in front of people with
6:00
people with a city that you know cares
6:02
as much as you do or maybe sometimes
6:04
cares more so I think that's what
6:07
poll pulls me back pulls other guys back
6:09
and it's just I mean it's just an
6:12
awesome City on the East Coast
6:14
um which you know is is Big too so uh
6:17
yeah I love being here and that's the
6:19
plan so that's the plan to stick around
6:20
long term here all that good stuff that
6:23
is the plan yeah
6:25
um well then to make the world better
6:26
Foundation you started here yeah was
6:30
that your first year yeah yeah in 2013
6:31
and just again like everybody does it
6:34
differently my four years in Houston
6:36
I've watched players try to start stuff
6:38
some successful and not successful and
6:41
when I came here I was like all right
6:42
I'm a you know I know how this NFL thing
6:45
works a little bit I've seen the good
6:46
and the bad that's when I you know
6:48
launched mtwb
6:51
and I've just been really fortunate to
6:53
work with great people partner with
6:55
great other organizations
6:57
sort of stick with it be committed to it
7:00
and uh it continues to go on I'm super
7:03
proud of what we've been able to do uh
7:05
and look forward to what we're going to
7:06
continue to do yeah yeah for those that
7:08
don't know exactly because you've kind
7:10
of run the gamut with what you've been
7:13
able to raise money for but specifically
7:16
playgrounds in the city which have sort
7:19
of sprung up all over the place so talk
7:20
about that and and what's to come yeah
7:23
so just
7:24
the real cliff notes of it are I grew up
7:27
a son of a police officer and city
7:30
manager and he really I really grew up
7:33
understanding the importance of public
7:34
space in a community
7:36
I grew up living at the playground like
7:39
that's where I was
7:42
um if I wasn't in school I was at the
7:44
playground playing basketball or
7:45
football sure so when I got to Philly I
7:47
said you know I want to I want to sort
7:48
of help rebuild playgrounds I mean every
7:50
every single person in the world agrees
7:53
that kids should have a safe place to
7:54
play for some reason we adults can't
7:56
figure out how to make that happen
7:59
um
7:59
but that's what we do we raise money
8:01
through the concert
8:03
um with partners and we are committed to
8:07
partnering with a neighborhood so people
8:09
that live there and use that public
8:10
space to redesign and then rebuild uh
8:14
the the public space how they think it
8:17
should be okay
8:19
um input from the people in the
8:21
community it's it's a long process you
8:23
know and now we're going to the 10 years
8:24
you know in total the four projects
8:27
we've done it's totaling up to 30
8:29
million dollars
8:30
um we we don't sort of
8:33
a helicopter in in like
8:36
paint the court put on new backboards
8:38
and then go to the next neighborhood
8:40
we really uh you know I have deep
8:43
relationships with people in these
8:44
neighborhoods that we've been fortunate
8:46
to work with but it takes time but we're
8:48
committed to it we think that you know
8:50
makes a playground stronger a community
8:51
stronger
8:53
um and we're gonna we're gonna try to
8:55
keep doing it uh
8:57
you know into the future so I'm super
8:58
proud of it we're finishing very rec
9:00
center in Gray's Ferry right now which
9:02
will which will be
9:04
you know the best rec center community
9:06
center that's been built in Philly and
9:08
probably the last 30 years which is
9:11
incredible how how far along should be
9:13
done
9:15
um later this year okay yeah I mean
9:17
it'll it'll definitely have all the
9:18
bells and whistles by next spring we'll
9:21
see if we can get it done before sort of
9:23
the everything freezes this winter but
9:25
the goal is sometime later this year so
9:26
is the goal for each one to be better
9:28
than the last one no not at all not at
9:31
all no no the goal is for it to be what
9:33
the neighborhood what they what they
9:35
want and what they need is really sort
9:36
of match match the the community that
9:38
the space is in so the concert has sort
9:40
of Taken on a life of its own I was at
9:42
the Dell uh really cool Alex G always
9:45
yeah really cool show packed yeah it's
9:49
the most people we've ever had through
9:50
the doors and we've you know we've had
9:51
some big bands so it's cool yeah what's
9:53
like the what's the dream
9:56
have you already had that the dream band
9:57
The Dream Act because the first was the
9:59
first one Kurt vile yeah first one
10:01
square vial okay yeah first one we have
10:03
another like DREAM Act that you want to
10:05
bring in here that would uh no I don't
10:07
you know no
10:08
um I don't
10:10
um
10:10
you know maybe like if Bruce Springsteen
10:12
wants to do a show I mean that would be
10:14
that would be pretty cool uh but no I
10:18
mean I'm I'm you know Alex G was awesome
10:20
Japanese was so awesome always Japanese
10:22
breakfast last year was an incredible
10:24
show Kurt vile uh the first year the war
10:27
on drugs I think one thing I
10:30
by myself thinking about
10:33
if we ever were to grow it was
10:36
you know I early in my career
10:39
as a music lover uh I used to go around
10:42
to music festivals because like when you
10:43
play NFL in the Summers like you have
10:45
time to do this stuff so I went to
10:47
Coachella a bunch I went to the festival
10:50
in Houston I went to Lollapalooza in
10:53
Chicago
10:54
I don't know whether I went to a bunch
10:56
and I would love to be a part of maybe
11:00
not a big Festival like palooza yeah but
11:04
maybe like a three nights in a row okay
11:07
and maybe a couple different venues I
11:09
drink a whole weekend out of it or
11:11
you know something something bigger like
11:13
a real Festival uh you know and maybe
11:16
there's an opportunity one big Festival
11:17
got canceled this year so maybe we'll
11:21
we'll figure something out in in the
11:23
future but I would love to do that just
11:24
to just to get more people involved
11:27
um you know and bring something special
11:29
to Philadelphia yeah funny you mentioned
11:31
that because my wife and I made it like
11:33
a date night so we came to the pre-party
11:36

14:10
retirement now it's like the fourth year
14:12
in a row but I thought I thought he was
14:14
serious
14:15
and he and he had he had thought that
14:18
too oh we for sure did and he had played
14:21
long enough
14:23
that had seen guys do well and not do
14:28
well into retirement
14:29
and Kelsey being a very thoughtful
14:33
person was thinking about what was next
14:36
for him and also thinking about
14:40
you know is there anything if you would
14:43
have like make a film about this would
14:45
it be helpful right because no one
14:48
no one sort of figured it out like what
14:50
is the big issue with guys transitioning
14:52
out
14:53
and so he said to me like maybe we do
14:55
this and I was like you know first of
14:57
all you're usually pretty good with
14:58
ideas so let's do this
15:00
so you know we started interviewing a
15:03
couple
15:04
people in the industry we eventually uh
15:08
got to know Don and Sheena from 914
15:10
pictures which is a local filmmaker here
15:13
in Philadelphia
15:14
and we started filming so two years ago
15:16
we started filming Kelsey away from the
15:18
building
15:19
luckily he didn't retire
15:21
and we sort of were like well let's just
15:24
keep filming and and then last year
15:27
happened and then we you know the season
15:28
was coming to end and Don and Sheena
15:30
said to me and Jason
15:32
like hey
15:34
I don't know if you guys want to keep
15:36
doing this like retirement thing and
15:38
this Don's talking to me I'm like hey I
15:39
don't think he's retiring if he's
15:40
playing this good we might be filming
15:42
another year and just this is gonna like
15:44
just keep on going and Don was like I
15:46
think there's something really special
15:48
here
15:49
about a guy a family a city and sort of
15:54
what it takes to be
15:57
to be great and all the people behind
16:00
the scenes to sort of make this whole
16:01
this whole thing go
16:04
um and so when the playoffs started
16:07
after the NFC Championship Game
16:11
we our crew was filming him at Chickie
16:13
and Pete's when he was watching his
16:14
brother NFL films
16:17
you know their job is to document the
16:19
league so they show up because they're
16:21
like you know this might be a Kelsey
16:24
Super Bowl so they realize like they
16:26
have to start filming the Kelsey family
16:27
at that point you know and shout out to
16:31
Keith and Pat and Jessica everybody at
16:33
NFL films they were like hey
16:35
well we were like hey we've been filming
16:37
him for two years and they were like oh
16:38
uh
16:39
let's uh get together and see if we can
16:42
do something and Idaho films was
16:44
unbelievable Keith and that crew and
16:46
then Don and US put our heads together
16:48
made this movie you you know I'm sort of
16:52
learning on the Fly we went and we sort
16:54
of pitched it to all the networks and
16:56
then Amazon was like this is amazing we
16:58
want to we want to we want to put this
16:59
out there on our our platform on Amazon
17:01
Prime and uh now
17:05
everybody will see it on Tuesday it was
17:07
crazy it really was and I'm super
17:08
excited for it I'm super excited for
17:10
Philadelphia like it is really
17:13
cool uh
17:15
how Philadelphia comes off in this in
17:17
this film I was sort of gonna be there's
17:19
a good segue because
17:21
I feel like we know Jason like he's like
17:24
the big brother of the city of
17:26
Philadelphia now everybody knows him
17:27
everybody's got a story about him or
17:30
um but is there something in this
17:32
without giving away the film but is
17:34
there something here that fans will
17:36
learn about Jason that maybe we didn't
17:38
already know
17:40
I would say for the fans here
17:42
yeah there's there's moments that no one
17:45
ever gets to see like I was talking to
17:47
my dad last night and about the film and
17:51
he was like he he experienced all those
17:54
moments as my father
17:56
after the game a loss uh you know what
18:00
happened on a Monday and Tuesday at the
18:02
house
18:03
you know when you're watching stuff on
18:04
TV about your kids like and so he all
18:07
saw that but the film we have all those
18:10
moments we have Kelsey and his family
18:13
three hours after they lost the Super
18:15
Bowl with his little girls
18:17
and it's like holy like it's I think
18:19
it's gonna be crazy for people to see
18:21
that sure and just how real it is but I
18:24
think at a high level people that know
18:26
Kelsey everybody knows him yeah and if
18:27
the film is just him being himself
18:29
you'll see for people that don't know
18:31
his wife oh my God she's a star and it's
18:36
great because she didn't she wanted
18:37
nothing to do with I remember three
18:39
years ago we're talking about she's like
18:40
I'm not getting involved you guys could
18:41
do this I don't want to be involved and
18:43
me and Kelsey were like
18:47
I mean it's gonna happen Kylie if we're
18:49
filming your your husband at home you're
18:51
going to be in it
18:53
um and she so she's great
18:55
uh but yeah no that's cool in the thing
18:59
was fun for me is
19:01
when we would pick you know we did a
19:03
little pitch with
19:05
HBO or whoever it was I would get a
19:10
random text or an email from somebody
19:13
from you know I'm making I don't
19:15
remember who would like say on HBO's
19:17
side yeah that would sort of text me
19:18
like man that was awesome
19:21
I live in
19:23
North Carolina and I wish we had I wish
19:26
we had a community like that you know
19:28
what I mean like people that are outside
19:30
of Philly you know on the West Coast or
19:32
wherever that saw it we're like man
19:33
that's crazy that's what that's what
19:35
it's like living in that City and
19:36
rooting for this team and we're like
19:38
that's that's what it's like so I think
19:41
that's gonna be fun for people to see
19:42
outside of this region this might be
19:44
like
19:45
like super cliche but do you
19:50
the real life Rocky Rocky in a sense
19:52
right
19:53
he's not coming from like nothing but
19:55
you know a sixth round pick
19:58
barely misses again when's the last time
20:00
he's missed the game it's been like a
20:01
decade uh wins a title for the city has
20:04
this amazing Hey listen wait to the art
20:06
museum steps it's like beyond amazing
20:08
speech I mean maybe the greatest maybe
20:12
all these things like yeah he's like the
20:14
epitome of our city like in wonder why
20:17
it's in the film touches on this a
20:19
little bit I mean there's a lot of
20:20
narratives but
20:23
and this is him and every how he goes
20:25
about his life but like he is perfect
20:27
for Philly like it is a perfect for
20:31
Philly
20:32
and he creates that like he made it
20:34
perfect yeah with who he is but yeah I
20:37
mean he was he was a walk-on yeah he
20:40
came from you know this humble normal
20:43
working class Cleveland Heights
20:45
Philadelphia
20:47
sixth round pick his brother I played
20:49
with I mean the whole family his brother
20:51
had you know I don't know when he's
20:52
drafted a second round bunch of people
20:54
passed him but he got kicked out of our
20:55
on off our football team like it is like
20:58
a little bit of a real life Rocky story
21:00
and
21:01
you know I don't I mean the film he's
21:04
happy with it it's weird for him having
21:06
a film be about him and his family so
21:08
you know when he talks about it it's
21:09
sort of putting but I can say
21:13
I like he's gonna get even more loved
21:16
here and if it's even possible like you
21:19
know what I mean it's it's people are
21:21
gonna love him even more I think I'm a
21:23
fair man with that guy yeah totally is
21:25
and then the out the Christmas album you
21:26
guys are working on a set part two right
21:28
Christmas album is done oh it's done
21:30
it's done it's locked it's getting
21:31
manufactured I'm way ahead we're way
21:33
ahead of it uh than we were last year
21:36
last year you know the
21:37
you know people that didn't get the the
21:39

21:44

21:55
um you can pre-order up until
21:56
Thanksgiving and then the online store

22:04
time to produce yeah that's why other
22:06
people do it anymore
22:07
um so we have to put in a number you
22:10
know so if you want to make sure you get
22:11
it early November put in your order
22:13
because people do care about that yeah
22:15
they want their hands on that thing it
22:17
was on the secondary what was it selling
22:18
for on the secondary Market it got a
22:20
little crazy for a bit there I think
22:22
there's still a couple grand for a
22:23
couple going for a couple thousand
22:24
dollars on eBay and stuff that's nuts
22:26
but that hey that speaks to Jason and
22:29

23:42
thanks Pat thanks I appreciate it yep
23:45
thanks



My name is Connor Bwin and this is my
0:02
Philly love story.
0:12
As a player, I remember some of the
0:14
great games, Sunday Night Football,
0:15
Monday Night Football. The two best
0:18
memories are NFC Championships and then
0:20
last year winning it and and you know
0:23
then ultimately going to the Super Bowl
0:24
and winning the Super Bowl um was really
0:26
special. Well, I'm special because, you
0:27
know, I'm there with my family on the
0:29
field, with all the players families,
0:31
with our, you know, other coaches
0:32
families, all the people that have
0:34
worked so hard to get there. Um,
0:37
celebrating and just the the pure joy of
0:39
it. And then the fans are still there.
0:41
So, it was like a big a victory for the
0:43
whole city. And to see my very young
0:46
kids understand how important it was uh
0:49
was very cool to see.
0:53
Make the World Better is a nonprofit
0:54
that we started in 2013 and our goal is
0:57
to partner with community to reimagine
1:00
and revitalize their public spaces. So,
1:03
I started Make the World Better when I
1:04
moved to Philadelphia in 2013 to play
1:06
for the Eagles. It was my fifth year in
1:09
the NFL and I had seen what other
1:12
players were doing around the league to
1:14
support their community. And when I
1:16
moved to Philadelphia, I decided I
1:18
wanted to do something and make an
1:19
impact. you know, growing up in the city
1:22
and spending so much time at the park
1:25
and in rec centers playing sports and
1:28
seeing the impact that sometimes only a
1:32
few individuals or a few adults can have
1:34
on a lot of kids in a small public
1:36
space. I knew that was something that I
1:38
wanted to be involved in and try and
1:40
create more of those safe, healthy
1:43
spaces for kids in Philadelphia. When I
1:45
see anybody enjoying these spaces, it
1:48
brings me joy. You know, that's what
1:50
parks I always say are supposed to be. A
1:51
place where you find joy for everybody.
1:53
For young kids to older kids to parents
1:57
to grandparents. Parks really at their
1:59
best are a magical place that bring
2:01
everyone together. You know, when you
2:03
think about kids, they need places to
2:05
play. They need places to
2:09
be independent. They need places to
2:11
learn how to deal with conflict, learn
2:13
how to be good teammates. They need
2:15
places to gain confidence. There's not
2:18
enough of those places in in most
2:21
cities. There's definitely not enough in
2:23
Philadelphia, but uh Philadelphia is
2:25
making, you know, big improvements in
2:27
their public space, and we hope we're
2:28
playing a small part in that.
2:30
Yes. Yes. Go birds.
2:33
For the last 10 years, we've been
2:34
hosting a benefit concert really to seed
2:38
uh funding for these parks. parks are,
2:41
you know, pretty uh expensive and uh,
2:44
you know, that's also comes from my love
2:47
of of music. Just like parks bring
2:49
people together, sports bring people
2:51
together, you know, the other one is
2:53
music brings people together.
2:54
This is the first time there's been
2:56
music in FDR Park in 31 years. The last
2:58
time
3:01
uh this year was really awesome. We're
3:02
able to bring the concert into the park.
3:06
Moving forward, we're working on trying
3:08
to bring more music back into the park
3:10
to bring more people together around
3:12
music to help fund future park projects
3:14
in the city.
3:17
I think my definition of love has grown
3:19
since moving to Philadelphia. I started
3:22
my family in Philadelphia. Uh got
3:24
married while I was living in
3:25
Philadelphia. Had two kids while I was
3:26
living in Philadelphia. I think I've
3:28
grown to love a lot more things um since
3:31
I' I've lived in Philadelphia. I never
3:33
I've always lived in Philadelphia. I
3:35
probably always will live in
3:36
Philadelphia. Um because it's the energy
3:39
that's in the city. It's not perfect.
3:41
There's issues at times. Um but I think
3:43
the benefits outweigh the cost for sure
3:46
when it comes to, you know, the energy,
3:49
the uniqueness of the people you get to
3:51
come across, the food, the music, the
3:53
opportunities to engage um with people
3:56
even in random situations. Those
3:59
wouldn't happen unless you put yourself
4:01
uh in an environment for it to happen.
4:03
And you know, I started in the city when
4:06
I got here, and I think I'll always be
4:07
here in the city.
