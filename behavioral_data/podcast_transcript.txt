INTERVIEWER: What's your investment philosophy?

SUBJECT: I look for growth. Real, sustainable growth. Not just revenue growth, but business model innovation. I want to find companies in inflection points where they're about to scale exponentially.

INTERVIEWER: How do you manage risk?

SUBJECT: I believe in asymmetric risk-reward. You take concentrated positions in your best ideas, but you also maintain some defensive positions. Maybe 20-30% of my portfolio is in lower-volatility assets like bonds or dividend stocks. The rest is in growth and momentum plays.

INTERVIEWER: Any regrets?

SUBJECT: I've made some overconfident bets that didn't work out. I thought I could predict market moves better than I actually could. Now I'm more systematic about position sizing.

INTERVIEWER: What about the recent downturn?

SUBJECT: Downturns are buying opportunities. Everyone gets scared, but if your time horizon is long, volatility is your friend. It creates entry points.

INTERVIEWER: Final thoughts?

SUBJECT: Stay confident in your thesis, but humble about your edges. I'm optimistic about the future, but I've learned to respect the market's ability to surprise me.
