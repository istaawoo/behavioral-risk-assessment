2:19
love what I do and working with the people that I get to work with and Gary kubak said to me early on he said it's
2:24
not worth it unless you enjoy the people you work with you know with how much work it takes to do this and right now I
2:30
really do enjoy being in Philadelphia enjoy the people that I get to work with you were born and raised in Detroit went
2:35
to UC as you noted played for four different NFL teams but somehow you
2:41
become like Mr Philly I mean a key part of the community very uh well known for
2:47
your charitable efforts in the city what was it about Philly why did that connect so well for you and your family yeah um
2:53
you know Philly is a great place it's a great you know it's located in a great place in the country right in the Northeast it's easy to get to a bunch of
2:59
great cities it's easy to get to Cincinnati and back to Philly um it's a sports town right there's a lot of
3:07
similarities to sort of the the sports and the blue collar nature is where I grew up in Detroit um but at the end of
3:13
the day for me um if you love sports the way I do and and you I love basketball I
3:18
love football I love all of it uh in Philly that's what it's about the city is built on Sports and the whole city
3:24
connects around the sports teams and so uh I've Loved when I got when I went there in 2013 to play
3:30
love playing there and then when I was done again how told me to come back and work for him when I was done playing so right away I knew uh that was where I
3:37
wanted to work there's been this unbelievable Cincinnati connection with the Eagles over the years I mean you
3:42
played with Trent Cole and Brent celic and it's it's continued over the years
3:48
is there a thing between the Cincinnati guys that have been with the Eagles well
3:53
yeah we're all really close I mean it's pretty incredible that for a couple years there 13 14 maybe 15
4:02
um there were four starters on the Eagles from the University of Cincinnati me and Trent on defense and then uh
4:09
Kelce and Cel on offense so we all have that bond together obviously I think we
4:15
all still live in yeah we all still live in Philadelphia and we're all pretty close uh as we were just talking before
4:21
the interview uh you know Kelsey still around all the time Cel still works you
4:26
know part-time for the team so we still see each other all the time and you know I think hoe you know I don't know
4:34
appreciates guys that come from UC I know you guys got some good players coming out this year that we're watching so hopefully we can get a couple good
4:40
Bearcats let's turn the clock back to 2005 when you became a bearcat how did
4:46
Mark dantonio convince you to come to Cincinnati well Mark's awesome but I got
4:53
to I got to be honest with you here what really happened was I was sort of under recruited I didn't play football
4:59
essentially sophomore and junior year and Mark Antonio was on a recruiting trip in
5:05
Detroit and then heard about me playing basketball so football season was over and I had offers to the max schools
5:12
right Bowling Green Eastern Michigan you know I actually thought I was probably going to Bowling Green cuz
5:17
they were pretty good at football at that time back in 04 or 05 and uh but
5:23
Mark Antonio happened to be recruiting somebody else in Detroit somebody said hey go watch this counter bar when play
5:30
basketball I was playing Brother Rice for anybody that knows Detroit you have Dej with Brother Rice big big big game
5:36
in high school basketball I had an awesome game I think I had like three dunks scored like 25 points there's a
5:43
huge gym full of people you know so Mark saw all that it it really it's funny I like it was
5:49
probably my best basketball game I played in high school Mark Mark just walked in and uh he offered me a
5:54
scholarship the next day and honestly I went to go visit Bowling Green then I
5:59
went to go visit UC and that was sort of just after Varsity Village had sort of been built
6:07
and it was the first year in the Big East so for me it was kind of a no-brainer you know going into the Big
6:13
East this was sort of a a big conference BCS conference at the time and the facilities were awesome so really you
6:20
know once I visited it was a no-brainer that I was going to go to go to UC it was you know
6:25
the best decision I ever made your recruiting class was incredible excuse
6:31
me Marty Gillard Mike mickens there were several others that became the core of
6:38
that Orange Bowl team your senior year did you have any idea that these guys
6:44
were really good players no I didn't um I'll give you two
6:50
two stories about that time that I think are interesting and and me and Kelsey
6:55
talk about the w a bunch first you know that team going to the orange B we often say we got the the perfect
7:03
combination of coaches right we went in there the first two years uh was Mark
7:09
Antonio's last two and Mark was sort of very family
7:15
oriented very connected you worked your ass off like
7:20
you know really sort of old school beat us down but toughened us up right and
7:27
then Brian came and we had two years really Brian was
7:33
ahead of the curb in my opinion and you know the way we trained the way we practiced the way we ran our offense and
7:39
defense was really sort of ahead of what other people were doing other programs were doing and so when you cond you you
7:46
put those two together sort of that Foundation of like toughness and connection that Mark Antonio built but
7:53
then you put on top of that sort of the the efficiency and um sort of the new
7:59
ways of working out and running you s of that's where you that's where it all came together and I don't think we were
8:04
going to the Orange Bowl or the year after they went to the sugar bow without those four years and those two
8:11
leaders that we had it really sort of worked they really compliment each other in our opinion uh and me and me and
8:16
Jason have always said that uh and I I still think about that often and then what's funny about you
8:22
said about our our class I'll never forget uh and I I you know talk to
8:28
people about this a lot when I went to see I did not have big dreams of playing
8:35
professional football you know it was you know I was the youngest of four getting a college
8:40
scholarship was a huge deal was nowhere near the NFL and our you know small town
8:48
family thing we had going on growing up and uh I was just happy to be get a
8:53
college scholarship I was going to be a high school coach and high school teacher it was like done
8:59
a week after being on campus my freshman year my whole Outlet completely changed
9:06
and I went from all right I'm happy to be here to be a high school coach and teacher to I'm going to go to the
9:11
NFL one week it's all it took because it just shows you know the importance of
9:18
sort of seeing someone that you know you you sort of relate to and it was Bren
9:23
celic so Bren celic sophomore year at UC had a great year so he was all over posters he was like all over over campus
9:30
and everybody was saying like oh there's one guy on the barad that's going to the NFL it's Brett C and I was his backup
9:36
and so we're doing summer workouts that summer and I was always in really good shape and I'm like running by him I'm
9:42
lifting as much as him I'm like if this guy can go to the NFL I can go to the NFL so my whole perspective changed and
9:49
uh I'm always I always teased Brun about that but uh you know I was incredibly
9:54
lucky to sort of be in a room with him right away and he sort of showed me what was possible
9:59
and it really changed you know my perspective my Outlook and how I approach things my four years that you
10:05
see cuz I I I believed right away that it was something that was possible I've had some great experiences as a
10:11
broadcaster but the Orange Bowl is very high on the list for this reason until
10:17
that point that never seemed possible to me for the University of Cincinnati to
10:23
play in games of that magnitude do you guys feel to this day that you help change the trajectory iory of UC
10:30
football forever you know I don't think about it in those terms but I'm sure it did cuz I
10:36
mean it's no different than what happened to me in seeing Bren celic you know the whole university and now I
10:41
think it's it's of course I mean you see you know continues to improve and grow
10:47
as a university um and I think you know especially with this changing landscape
10:53
there's so much opportunity for the University of Cincinnati and I hope that the leaders that you see and the players
11:01
and you know everybody that's there has the highest of goals and aspiration cuz there's no reason UC can't do anything
11:09
that any other university is capable of doing you mentioned Mark de Antonio
11:14
seeing you play high school basketball and you had the great game so your freshman year Armen Kirkland gets hurt
11:21
yeah Andy Kennedy's looking for a basketball player somebody that can help out coach dantonio says yeah I think
11:27
this guy could probably help and you wound up playing a significant role for two years one under Andy one under Mick
11:34
yeah how special was that experience for a guy who ultimately spent a decade playing pro football I mean one of the
11:41
the most special times of my life honestly uh I'm so lucky I will never
11:47
forget ever you know Mark coach calling me I'm in Detroit I win a break with IND
11:53
a bowl game he's like hey can you drive back you know you might they might need somebody to do practice on the
11:58
basketball team team and that was like a dream of mine like I I wanted to be a professional basketball player not a
12:03
football player and so this was just this incredible opportunity go into a quiet Fifth Third arena with Cory blunt
12:12
and like shoot around for 30 minutes and then Cy's like all right I think this is going to work come back
12:18
tomorrow and two days later you know I have a I'm 51 the
12:24
Jersey doesn't really fit me there's no name on my jersey these huge Jordan like
12:30
you know warm-ups and I'm sitting on the the bench and we're playing Syracuse and
12:36
I like I had just worked out with Cory B like 2 days ago and uh I'm like this is
12:41
awesome like this is so cool I'm going to sit here and just enjoy this all all year as like a fan of basketball and big
12:48
time Big East basketball and Andy Kennedy walks down about 9 minutes into
12:53
the game and it's like looks at me he's like hey you ready
12:59
and I was not ready at all and I L was in shock and I was like you me and he's
13:04
like no get in and I I I I mean I swear I'll never forget it I didn't even like know how to like do it and I just sort
13:12
of found my way to the scoring table dead ball I check in you know don't know
13:18
what I'm doing there's a loose ball I dive for the loose ball before I mean again before I know I'm shooting a free throw you know in in Fifth Third Arena
13:25
and people are going crazy I was just like hit the rim hit the rim H the and I think I hit the rip and then the rest
13:31
was history it was just the most fun times played with so many great players you know got to play in great Arenas did
13:37
it for two years I'm proud I think I averaged over 10 minutes uh in every game that I was on the team and honestly
13:43
I look back I wish I would have played all four years that's the only thing you know I have I would have still played in the NFL for you know 10 years um you
13:51
know it all worked out great but I think I had so much fun playing basketball I wish I would have played you know the
13:56
rest of my career and we've seen guys do it you know I mean so um I I would encourage if any college athlete had the
14:03
opportunity to do both do it as long as you can excuse me your sophomore year you
14:12
are asked to guard the number one pick in the NBA draft later that year Greg Odin great matchup yeah yeah I had a
14:19
cover in Sports Illustrated it's still the magazine is still in my uh garage um
14:24
yeah that was fun I uh yeah we battled fortunate I you know it would have been
14:30
cooler if he ended up having a better career but he was still really good at that point and I think the the I don't
14:36
know seven or eight minutes that I was in there guarding him uh I don't think he scored so I uh I was pretty pretty
14:43
happy with that was a fun that was a fun memory let's talk about but but I'll give you the real the other one so the one that wasn't as good was Jeff Green
14:50
who turned out to have a great NBA career the only guy that truly really
14:56
dunked on me and he I I got switched onto him and I was I you know when I got
15:02
switched on to like a really good player I was like all right the only way to do this is just not let him get the ball so you know I'm covered him really tight
15:09
and he sort of ran up and then back door they threw a alyu but I'm like running behind him and he just yeah it wasn't a
15:16
good play but uh it's kind of cool to see how how how great his career was you average 10 minutes a game in the Big
15:21
East you're going to get Dunt at some point back in those days let's talk about the decision that really changed
15:27
your football life going into your senior year you move from tight end to defensive end largely driven by the
15:35
hearing loss that you were born with in one year yeah I I don't know if it was largely driven I think that was a b you
15:43
know it helped me cuz the hearing was a little bit of an issue when I played tight end I think it was largely driven
15:51
by the makeup of our team and
15:57
Brian didn't really use a tight end and he could sort of interchange a tight end
16:03
with you know a wide receiver and he saw me and was like all right you you're you can be you know
16:08
this valuable on offense or if you play defensive end which we have a hole at defensive end you could be a lot more
16:15
valuable and you know he really sold it to me and it wasn't like it was a hard sell but I'll never forget he was like
16:21
Hey if you play this why Brian Smart he hey if you play tight end first of all I
16:26
don't really call a lot of plays for a tight end but I got a call play the offensive
16:32
Line's got a block for the quarterback then the quarterback's got to decide to throw it to you and make a good throw and then you have an opportunity to you
16:39
know add some value in production it's like if you play defensive end which is not this simple I know but he's like if
16:45
you play defensive end every play It's Just You versus The Tackle you could you could make you could have production
16:50
every single play and I was like man that's a sounds reasonable that's a good way to look at it and uh so made the
16:56
switch that spring and you know obviously it was was a was a great move for me and for the team I don't even
17:04
know if you know this but a few years later the year that Travis Kelce was suspended and couldn't play and Butch
17:10
Jones was the Cincinnati head coach they were about that close moving him to
17:15
defensive end because of your success well it's good that they didn't do that
17:21
now I will say I could have I know I could have played tight end in the NFL for a decade
17:28
just like I played defensive end um I'm confident that I could have done that I really loved playing defense I will
17:35
never forget I think I was a defensive end
17:40
it's probably my senior year but Travis came in as like a athlete
17:46
quarterback and I think that was what he was his first two years
17:51
maybe there was questions about Lineback or something but I'll NE I will I swear Dan I'll never for I've only seen this
17:57
once in my life he and I cuz I knew tight end cuz I played tight end he came and they moved in tight
18:04
end and I remember him just getting in his three-point stance and like coming
18:09
out and running routes and then like reach blocking you know trais is bigger than most people realize like I'm 6'4
18:15
he's like a real 65 and sort of and I remember the first day of practice
18:20
watching him sort of just come out of his stance and run routes and come out and block people cuz people are real awkward like getting down I was like
18:27
he'll never play another position this is the smoothest I've ever seen a tight end get out of his stance in a run
18:35
play and in a pass play it took like 30 minutes for me to see that and I was
18:40
like well he'll never he'll never play another position or he shouldn't because I've never seen a guy initially look so
18:47
comfortable in that position and obviously you know he's now probably the greatest tight end of
18:53
all time and his brother might be the greatest Center of all time he's certainly on the list how incredible is
19:00
that as his former teammate and obviously knowing Travis as well that these two guys who came to Cincinnati
19:07
unheralded in Jason's case a walk-on have become what they've become both on and off the field yeah it's it's so cool
19:14
I mean I remember last year or two yeah two years ago when it start of this started to
19:21
happen with with Kelsey um I remember me and Brent celic were sitting there and
19:26
we're like Brent said couldn't happen to a better guy and that's simply the truth you know
19:32
what I mean like all of the accolades all of the attention that him and Travis
19:38
get now rightfully so couldn't happen to better people I mean their parents them
19:44
it's all it's all real and they're just great people and happy for them um and
19:50
then for for Jason especially like me and Brent who were with them you know we saw it it wasn't all roses you know what
19:57
I mean like it it's a really great story and he was a really good player in
20:02
2016 you know we didn't have a great year sort of I was a product I I left the Eagles cuz when you have when you're
20:09
not good in the NFL they make a lot more moves um and he was on the trading block
20:14
and pretty much everyone was like ready to get rid of him that was very real he sort of
20:22
refocuses gets better uh wins the Super Bowl and then like Pro all pro pro bowl
20:29
all pro pro bowl I just starts stacking them up you know what I mean it's just a uh a testament to his commitment his you
20:37
know how smart he is and how hard he worked you had a great career pro bowler
20:42
14 1 12 sack season a lot of great individual accomplishments you on some really good teams what was the highlight
20:49
for you well hopefully the Highlight is Sunday when uh we win the Super Bowl but
20:56
the highlight of my 10year career um it's hard for me to pick one honestly
21:03
I mean I I I just played with so many great guys I think you know we had a core I mean I just love being a part of
21:09
a team honestly and in Houston you know there was a couple special years there
21:14
where we were a top defense it was the first time the Texans ever made the playoffs as a young franchise you know I
21:20
was playing for Wade Phillips and Gary kubak we had demo Ryan Mario Williams Sean Cody Brian Cushing Antonio Smith
21:28
just a great uh Jonathan Joseph from Cincinnati uh Glover Quinn all these
21:34
guys just unbelievable people at Philly you know we had the chip Kell I was part of the Chip Kelly which was really
21:40
interesting those first couple years but again playing black with Kelsey and uh Trent and celic demo again um a bunch of
21:49
you know Todd Herman Jason Peters Evan Matt just great LESA McCoy djck great
21:55
people great people to playb all about I mean that's it and I can keep going but same thing in in LA with sha McBay and
22:00
Todd Gurley and Aaron Donald um same thing at the Giants at the end with Eli Manning and Odell Beckham we just it's
22:07
it's fun to be around those great players that are good people and want to be part of a team so
22:13
I think I take you know I've always sort of cherished all of those groups of people and teams I've been a part of you
22:19
missed the last Eagle Super Bowl win by one season the Philly special Super Bowl
22:24
win over the Patriots how long did that take to to get over having invested so
22:30
much time and Blood Sweat and Tears into helping the Eagles get there yeah
22:36
honestly you know I that was 2016 so I played four years in Philly started
22:42
every single game very much as you said like I live in the city I understand I always said like I understand what it
22:48
probably means to win a Super Bowl as much as anybody cuz I lived in that City and was so connected to the community so
22:55
because of contracts and and you know the team went a different Direction I was in LA in
23:00
17 now we had a great year in La really great team made the playoffs first time in you know I don't know 12
23:07
years but it was really hard um and as
23:12
happy as I was for everybody I was sort of you know in my feelings like damn I wanted to be there and I can tell you
23:19
it's really funny to look back on because I wouldn't say that out loud but
23:26
me and my wife were during the Super Bowl I was trying to get as far away as
23:32
I could from Phil and I still lived in Philly so we were in New Zealand during
23:37
the you succeeded got when I look I was look as far as possible I was in freaking New Zealand during the Super
23:43
Bowl in 17 but when did I when did it change was
23:49
during the Super Bowl Parade so I was in New Zealand watching it and sort of tracking the whole thing and just
23:54
watching the coverage of all of that I got over myself quickly and I was just like man this is so freaking awesome for
24:03
everybody on the team that was involved for the city um and that was it it was
24:09
really watching the parade and I was like you know get over yourself this is so cool and I was so happy for everybody and now you know it continues to
24:15
motivate me to be a part of a team to to win aall and that's why I'm so excited to be here in New Orleans yeah hopefully
24:21
we're watching you and parade footage in another week or so let's touch on a couple of things pro uh post NFL before
24:27
we wrap up including the MBA from Warden the School of Business at Penn this is one of the
24:34
most prestigious business degrees that you can have why did you do it and how
24:39
hard was it to earn yeah it it was the hardest thing I ever did honestly um you know like I
24:45
said early after a week at the University of Cincinnati I decided I was going to go
24:50
to the NFL so I didn't exactly Focus as much as maybe I should have in my my
24:56
four years at UC now I always took always did fine in school and took it relatively serious but Wharton was a
25:02
whole different I mean it was like a whole different thing uh and so I was working fulltime uh at the Eagles and
25:08
then doing it on the weekends and I appreciate the Eagles allowing me to do that um but it was the hardest thing I
25:13
ever did learned so much I knew when I was done playing um that I wanted to
25:22
continue to be a part of teams and add value and and be successful and I had
25:27
sort of was aware of guys that played a long time in the NFL and most didn't
25:33
have that awareness like your your life doesn't stop when you're done playing football so I I saw you know I'm in
25:40
Philadelphia so I'm aware of of pan and Wharton and I decided to to take a
25:46
chance at it and studied for it and it was a huge Challenge and and learned a ton and so thankful that I did it so the
25:53
way it sort of sort of retes you to think about
25:58
problems a little bit differently and the way it allows you to now have you know conversations with at least in in
26:05
my current job with you know people across departments so to have that language across departments is something
26:11
that I really learned going to business school and have I read correctly that you and your business school buddies
26:17
have purchased an Italian professional basketball team we did yeah we did so
26:22
those are the fun those are the fun things about going to work and you meet a lot of uh really smart people so we we
26:29
you know we put together a group of us and raised some money and and bought a professional basketball team in Italy
26:34
and that's been great I mean I I uh bought the team it wasn't great at first the team got relegated after we bought
26:41
it which was not good but I was able to spend two summers you
26:47
know our in the NFL pretty much end of June July is like the time off so I was able to spend those 6 weeks hiring a
26:55
general manager and a head coach and it was is one of the coolest things I've ever done not one of the hardest things
27:00
I've ever done um but sort of going through that process you know we interviewed probably five different
27:05
people from Italy probably 10 different people from the NBA got to meet a ton of
27:11
people got to learn a lot ultimately hired uh Michael areri is the GM he's
27:17
still there and the head coach Jamie and Christian team got promoted we're back in Syria now and uh the team's sitting
27:24
at 6th uh on the table and I will go visit the team after after you know the
27:30
football season's over I love it and that's not the only way you are a renaissance man you were involved in
27:35
producing the Kelsey documentary you've been really instrumental in these Christmas albums that Jason's been
27:42
involved in that have raised a ton of money for charity does your brain just want to you know dip a finger into a
27:48
million different things yeah I I I probably need to start to pull some of that back but like I am and this
27:55
was part of going to Business School I do try to like cast the net
28:02
and I don't think I know that much but I [Music]
28:08
do have a decent Judgment of people and good ideas and opportunities and know how to look at opportunities better
28:14
especially after go into business school and I definitely got lucky a few times
28:21
but you know I know a good amount of people I know Kelsey and like when he
28:26
came to me about you know making a film I was like yeah yeah you're you're
28:31
a good character we should we should do this and definitely sort of got lucky but that turned out to be a great film
28:36
and learned a ton and then when when laye and Jordan and and Jason you know said hey we have this crazy idea about a
28:42
Christmas record I was like hey well I know a lot of people in the music business like why don't we just do it
28:48
let's figure it out and do it and so I think when I sort of see opportunities I can't help myself when I think they're
28:53
good to try to put a group of people together and try to figure it out and that's you know those two examples uh we
28:59
just finding a way to put a good group of people together to do something fun and creative and ultimately good and uh
29:07
yeah I I uh when I see them I try to take advantage of it you know last thing
29:14
you received an outstanding alumni award from UC last year when you look back at those four years playing for the two
29:20
football coaches you mentioned plus Andy Kennedy plus Mick Cronin the classes you took the students that you got to know
29:27
how did all of that add up to to where you are
29:34
now I am so grateful to have gone to such a great University I mean I really
29:39
am it was I try to get back at least once a year it was very cool to get the alumni award last year and see how well
29:45
the school is doing um you know I think all of us that went there especially you know the group that we've been talking
29:50
about we're just super proud of sort of the trajectory of the university and all of the leadership there I think for me
29:58
you know I was a kid really stupid kid when I went to UC and I was there for 4
30:07
years and was just sort of shaped by coaches you know the support staff the
30:14
trainers all of the people around that you know or that University um that just
30:21
helped me mature as an adult and you know I definitely had some hiccups I mean I was kicked out of my dorms at one
30:27
point I mean I was an idiot but I was held accountable for the most part and really you
30:33
know walked in as a as a pretty dumb 18-year-old and sort of walked out as a
30:39
not quite as dumb 21y old but have continued to grow uh since I left there
30:45
and and uh very proud of the University continue to want to stay connected to the university uh and you know excited
30:51
about the football team and the basketball team and and what the school's doing as a whole we're proud of you really appreciate and Cincinnati as
30:58

0:13
Jason Kelsey Connor barwin's here what's

0:17
doing great thanks for having me yeah
0:18
man thanks for for coming in um right
0:20
off the bat obviously season starts this
0:22
weekend what's the you get like the
0:24
butterfly like do you still get the
0:26
butterflies now that you're no longer
0:28
playing does it still feel the same way
0:30
no I do not but I do
0:33
um
0:34
you know before training camp starts
0:37
it's weird
0:38
uh like sort of the end of July middle
0:40
of July
0:41
like my body is on a rhythm yeah and I
0:45
can just like look around in July and be
0:48
like
0:49
I'm supposed to be going to train right
0:51
and so like it feels right once training
0:53
camp comes and then I'm still in the
0:54
same Rhythm where after six weeks I'm
0:57
like
0:58
that was about the right amount of time
0:59
it's time to play real games and so I'm
1:01
I'm definitely feeling that right now
1:03
and
1:03
you know don't get the butterflies but
1:05
just as excited as always to you know
1:07
for week one it was great watching the
1:10
game last night excited for Sunday yeah
1:12
um as director of Player Development
1:14
what is that entail like what are you up
1:16
to yeah uh we don't talk about it it's a
1:20
little bit secretive because I think
1:21
it's uh
1:22
you know how is how we started Player
1:24
Development I don't know six seven years
1:26
ago it's uh not really
1:30
you know a lot of people everybody has
1:31
player engagement our Player Development
1:33
I'll just say is really more focused on
1:35
our younger players onboarding our
1:37
players into Philadelphia into the
1:40
Eagles and then a focus uh on on field
1:45
development from the jump when they get
1:47
there and trying to accelerate that
1:49
development and
1:51
it's possible because you know Howie's
1:54
leadership in Nick's leadership I mean
1:55
Nick is all about developing players
1:59
developing players and that's not always
2:01
the case in the NFL
2:03
uh you know Nick came from a D3
2:05
background where you had to develop guys
2:07
sure in college
2:09
um in the NFL some teams don't because
2:11
you know you got the college football
2:13
system you got free agency you know sort
2:16
of weeds itself out in some ways but
2:18
that's not how he wants to approach it
2:20
that's not how uh Nick wants to approach
2:22
it and so
2:23
uh I you know love what I do and really
2:27
just focused on helping these guys get
2:28
better uh as quickly as possible so
2:30
they're ready whenever they get their
2:31
chance do you do you look at this like
2:33
this like stepping stone like do you
2:36
want to stay involved behind the scenes
2:38
in this sort of way do you see yourself
2:40
more as a coach or like how do you yeah
2:42
I feel like uh
2:44
I don't know I'm just you know I was
2:46
trying to have a good day I was trying
2:48
to have a good day today so far it's
2:49
been good next week you know next week
2:52
I'll try to no I mean my focus is just
2:54
every year trying to be really good at
2:57
what I do and add value to the team and
2:58
our players and you know next year
3:01
I don't know what I'll be doing but I do
3:04
love what I do now like I I feel like I
3:06
got the best job in our building because
3:08
I get to work with the coaches I get to
3:10
work with Howie in the front office I
3:12
get to work with everybody and still
3:13
like work with the players directly so I
3:15
love my job taking one week one season
3:18
at a time you said you find yourself
3:19
like getting into the rhythm of the
3:21
season do you still miss the playing
3:23
aspect of it does that ever really go
3:25
away
3:26
you know I
3:27
I don't think I miss it that much
3:29
because I
3:30
I gave it everything I had my body is in
3:33
Fairly good condition now if I sort of
3:35
overdo it working out now I know yeah
3:39
and so
3:40
you know when I watch these guys I don't
3:42
have the urge to go put a helmet on and
3:44
run through somebody because I I did
3:46
that enough you know what I mean um now
3:48
I to be honest with you like well
3:51
you know Super Bowl last year yeah you
3:53
know you would you miss like I would
3:55
have loved to be out there and have that
3:56
chance you know probably Sunday the
3:58
first game of the year the first home
4:00
game at the link I'll be like man this
4:01
is these were these special moments but
4:04
um I still cherish just my role in being
4:07
there how I am now
4:09
um so I don't miss it that much
4:12
um you are still very heavily involved
4:14
in the city make the world better
4:16
Foundation
4:17
um was just at the concert you guys put
4:19
on a great show it was fantastic
4:21
um but so you were here for four years
4:24
you played in the league 10 right so you
4:28
played starting Houston came to Philly
4:30
um what is it though about this city
4:32
that is so
4:34
like the magnetism that keeps guys here
4:37
well
4:38
just to go out down memory lane a little
4:41
bit how it happened drafted to you know
4:43
grew up in Detroit Cincinnati for
4:45
college
4:45
drafted to Houston when lived in Texas
4:48
for four years I always thought for
4:51
whatever reason it was important to live
4:52
where you play
4:54
um and so I lived in Houston I loved it
4:56
and then Kelsey Selleck all these guys
4:59
sort of told me man Philly's a special
5:01
place when I became a free agent came to
5:04
Philly and then you know the best four
5:06
years of my career were statistically uh
5:10
the four years in Philly
5:12
it's when my wife moved to in to Philly
5:15
and we got very serious she has a great
5:17
job at pen and chop
5:20
um when I left after four years
5:22
I just knew I was coming back just
5:25
because this is where we sort of put
5:26
Roots down when how he let me go he said
5:28
hey I want you to come work you know
5:30
work for us when you're done go play as
5:32
long as you can and then come work for
5:33
us
5:34
um but I think me and other players that
5:36
have been here
5:37
and I I you know I talk a lot about this
5:40
to our young players when they come in
5:42
this is really the best place to play
5:45
if you love football because you're
5:48
playing for a fan base
5:50
that that deeply cares about what you do
5:53
like and if you if you love football and
5:56
you care about it a lot it's really
5:58
awesome to play in front of people with
6:00
people with a city that you know cares
6:02
as much as you do or maybe sometimes
6:04
cares more so I think that's what
6:07
poll pulls me back pulls other guys back
6:09
and it's just I mean it's just an
6:12
awesome City on the East Coast
6:14
um which you know is is Big too so uh
6:17
yeah I love being here and that's the
6:19
plan so that's the plan to stick around
6:20
long term here all that good stuff that
6:23
is the plan yeah
6:25
um well then to make the world better
6:26
Foundation you started here yeah was
6:30
that your first year yeah yeah in 2013
6:31
and just again like everybody does it
6:34
differently my four years in Houston
6:36
I've watched players try to start stuff
6:38
some successful and not successful and
6:41
when I came here I was like all right
6:42
I'm a you know I know how this NFL thing
6:45
works a little bit I've seen the good
6:46
and the bad that's when I you know
6:48
launched mtwb
6:51
and I've just been really fortunate to
6:53
work with great people partner with
6:55
great other organizations
6:57
sort of stick with it be committed to it
7:00
and uh it continues to go on I'm super
7:03
proud of what we've been able to do uh
7:05
and look forward to what we're going to
7:06
continue to do yeah yeah for those that
7:08
don't know exactly because you've kind
7:10
of run the gamut with what you've been
7:13
able to raise money for but specifically
7:16
playgrounds in the city which have sort
7:19
of sprung up all over the place so talk
7:20
about that and and what's to come yeah
7:23
so just
7:24
the real cliff notes of it are I grew up
7:27
a son of a police officer and city
7:30
manager and he really I really grew up
7:33
understanding the importance of public
7:34
space in a community
7:36
I grew up living at the playground like
7:39
that's where I was
7:42
um if I wasn't in school I was at the
7:44
playground playing basketball or
7:45
football sure so when I got to Philly I
7:47
said you know I want to I want to sort
7:48
of help rebuild playgrounds I mean every
7:50
every single person in the world agrees
7:53
that kids should have a safe place to
7:54
play for some reason we adults can't
7:56
figure out how to make that happen
7:59
um
7:59
but that's what we do we raise money
8:01
through the concert
8:03
um with partners and we are committed to
8:07
partnering with a neighborhood so people
8:09
that live there and use that public
8:10
space to redesign and then rebuild uh
8:14
the the public space how they think it
8:17
should be okay
8:19
um input from the people in the
8:21
community it's it's a long process you
8:23
know and now we're going to the 10 years
8:24
you know in total the four projects
8:27
we've done it's totaling up to 30
8:29
million dollars
8:30
um we we don't sort of
8:33
a helicopter in in like
8:36
paint the court put on new backboards
8:38
and then go to the next neighborhood
8:40
we really uh you know I have deep
8:43
relationships with people in these
8:44
neighborhoods that we've been fortunate
8:46
to work with but it takes time but we're
8:48
committed to it we think that you know
8:50
makes a playground stronger a community
8:51
stronger
8:53
um and we're gonna we're gonna try to
8:55
keep doing it uh
8:57
you know into the future so I'm super
8:58
proud of it we're finishing very rec
9:00
center in Gray's Ferry right now which
9:02
will which will be
9:04
you know the best rec center community
9:06
center that's been built in Philly and
9:08
probably the last 30 years which is
9:11
incredible how how far along should be
9:13
done
9:15
um later this year okay yeah I mean
9:17
it'll it'll definitely have all the
9:18
bells and whistles by next spring we'll
9:21
see if we can get it done before sort of
9:23
the everything freezes this winter but
9:25
the goal is sometime later this year so
9:26
is the goal for each one to be better
9:28
than the last one no not at all not at
9:31
all no no the goal is for it to be what
9:33
the neighborhood what they what they
9:35
want and what they need is really sort
9:36
of match match the the community that
9:38
the space is in so the concert has sort
9:40
of Taken on a life of its own I was at
9:42
the Dell uh really cool Alex G always
9:45
yeah really cool show packed yeah it's
9:49
the most people we've ever had through
9:50
the doors and we've you know we've had
9:51
some big bands so it's cool yeah what's
9:53
like the what's the dream
9:56
have you already had that the dream band
9:57
The Dream Act because the first was the
9:59
first one Kurt vile yeah first one
10:01
square vial okay yeah first one we have
10:03
another like DREAM Act that you want to
10:05
bring in here that would uh no I don't
10:07
you know no
10:08
um I don't
10:10
um
10:10
you know maybe like if Bruce Springsteen
10:12
wants to do a show I mean that would be
10:14
that would be pretty cool uh but no I
10:18
mean I'm I'm you know Alex G was awesome
10:20
Japanese was so awesome always Japanese
10:22
breakfast last year was an incredible
10:24
show Kurt vile uh the first year the war
10:27
on drugs I think one thing I
10:30
by myself thinking about
10:33
if we ever were to grow it was
10:36
you know I early in my career
10:39
as a music lover uh I used to go around
10:42
to music festivals because like when you
10:43
play NFL in the Summers like you have
10:45
time to do this stuff so I went to
10:47
Coachella a bunch I went to the festival
10:50
in Houston I went to Lollapalooza in
10:53
Chicago
10:54
I don't know whether I went to a bunch
10:56
and I would love to be a part of maybe
11:00
not a big Festival like palooza yeah but
11:04
maybe like a three nights in a row okay
11:07
and maybe a couple different venues I
11:09
drink a whole weekend out of it or
11:11
you know something something bigger like
11:13
a real Festival uh you know and maybe
11:16
there's an opportunity one big Festival
11:17
got canceled this year so maybe we'll
11:21
we'll figure something out in in the
11:23
future but I would love to do that just
11:24
to just to get more people involved
11:27
um you know and bring something special
11:29
to Philadelphia yeah funny you mentioned
11:31
that because my wife and I made it like
11:33
a date night so we came to the pre-party
11:36

14:10
retirement now it's like the fourth year
14:12
in a row but I thought I thought he was
14:14
serious
14:15
and he and he had he had thought that
14:18
too oh we for sure did and he had played
14:21
long enough
14:23
that had seen guys do well and not do
14:28
well into retirement
14:29
and Kelsey being a very thoughtful
14:33
person was thinking about what was next
14:36
for him and also thinking about
14:40
you know is there anything if you would
14:43
have like make a film about this would
14:45
it be helpful right because no one
14:48
no one sort of figured it out like what
14:50
is the big issue with guys transitioning
14:52
out
14:53
and so he said to me like maybe we do
14:55
this and I was like you know first of
14:57
all you're usually pretty good with
14:58
ideas so let's do this
15:00
so you know we started interviewing a
15:03
couple
15:04
people in the industry we eventually uh
15:08
got to know Don and Sheena from 914
15:10
pictures which is a local filmmaker here
15:13
in Philadelphia
15:14
and we started filming so two years ago
15:16
we started filming Kelsey away from the
15:18
building
15:19
luckily he didn't retire
15:21
and we sort of were like well let's just
15:24
keep filming and and then last year
15:27
happened and then we you know the season
15:28
was coming to end and Don and Sheena
15:30
said to me and Jason
15:32
like hey
15:34
I don't know if you guys want to keep
15:36
doing this like retirement thing and
15:38
this Don's talking to me I'm like hey I
15:39
don't think he's retiring if he's
15:40
playing this good we might be filming
15:42
another year and just this is gonna like
15:44
just keep on going and Don was like I
15:46
think there's something really special
15:48
here
15:49
about a guy a family a city and sort of
15:54
what it takes to be
15:57
to be great and all the people behind
16:00
the scenes to sort of make this whole
16:01
this whole thing go
16:04
um and so when the playoffs started
16:07
after the NFC Championship Game
16:11
we our crew was filming him at Chickie
16:13
and Pete's when he was watching his
16:14
brother NFL films
16:17
you know their job is to document the
16:19
league so they show up because they're
16:21
like you know this might be a Kelsey
16:24
Super Bowl so they realize like they
16:26
have to start filming the Kelsey family
16:27
at that point you know and shout out to
16:31
Keith and Pat and Jessica everybody at
16:33
NFL films they were like hey
16:35
well we were like hey we've been filming
16:37
him for two years and they were like oh
16:38
uh
16:39
let's uh get together and see if we can
16:42
do something and Idaho films was
16:44
unbelievable Keith and that crew and
16:46
then Don and US put our heads together
16:48
made this movie you you know I'm sort of
16:52
learning on the Fly we went and we sort
16:54
of pitched it to all the networks and
16:56
then Amazon was like this is amazing we
16:58
want to we want to we want to put this
16:59
out there on our our platform on Amazon
17:01
Prime and uh now
17:05
everybody will see it on Tuesday it was
17:07
crazy it really was and I'm super
17:08
excited for it I'm super excited for
17:10
Philadelphia like it is really
17:13
cool uh
17:15
how Philadelphia comes off in this in
17:17
this film I was sort of gonna be there's
17:19
a good segue because
17:21
I feel like we know Jason like he's like
17:24
the big brother of the city of
17:26
Philadelphia now everybody knows him
17:27
everybody's got a story about him or
17:30
um but is there something in this
17:32
without giving away the film but is
17:34
there something here that fans will
17:36
learn about Jason that maybe we didn't
17:38
already know
17:40
I would say for the fans here
17:42
yeah there's there's moments that no one
17:45
ever gets to see like I was talking to
17:47
my dad last night and about the film and
17:51
he was like he he experienced all those
17:54
moments as my father
17:56
after the game a loss uh you know what
18:00
happened on a Monday and Tuesday at the
18:02
house
18:03
you know when you're watching stuff on
18:04
TV about your kids like and so he all
18:07
saw that but the film we have all those
18:10
moments we have Kelsey and his family
18:13
three hours after they lost the Super
18:15
Bowl with his little girls
18:17
and it's like holy like it's I think
18:19
it's gonna be crazy for people to see
18:21
that sure and just how real it is but I
18:24
think at a high level people that know
18:26
Kelsey everybody knows him yeah and if
18:27
the film is just him being himself
18:29
you'll see for people that don't know
18:31
his wife oh my God she's a star and it's
18:36
great because she didn't she wanted
18:37
nothing to do with I remember three
18:39
years ago we're talking about she's like
18:40
I'm not getting involved you guys could
18:41
do this I don't want to be involved and
18:43
me and Kelsey were like
18:47
I mean it's gonna happen Kylie if we're
18:49
filming your your husband at home you're
18:51
going to be in it
18:53
um and she so she's great
18:55
uh but yeah no that's cool in the thing
18:59
was fun for me is
19:01
when we would pick you know we did a
19:03
little pitch with
19:05
HBO or whoever it was I would get a
19:10
random text or an email from somebody
19:13
from you know I'm making I don't
19:15
remember who would like say on HBO's
19:17
side yeah that would sort of text me
19:18
like man that was awesome
19:21
I live in
19:23
North Carolina and I wish we had I wish
19:26
we had a community like that you know
19:28
what I mean like people that are outside
19:30
of Philly you know on the West Coast or
19:32
wherever that saw it we're like man
19:33
that's crazy that's what that's what
19:35
it's like living in that City and
19:36
rooting for this team and we're like
19:38
that's that's what it's like so I think
19:41
that's gonna be fun for people to see
19:42
outside of this region this might be
19:44
like
19:45
like super cliche but do you
19:50
the real life Rocky Rocky in a sense
19:52
right
19:53
he's not coming from like nothing but
19:55
you know a sixth round pick
19:58
barely misses again when's the last time
20:00
he's missed the game it's been like a
20:01
decade uh wins a title for the city has
20:04
this amazing Hey listen wait to the art
20:06
museum steps it's like beyond amazing
20:08
speech I mean maybe the greatest maybe
20:12
all these things like yeah he's like the
20:14
epitome of our city like in wonder why
20:17
it's in the film touches on this a
20:19
little bit I mean there's a lot of
20:20
narratives but
20:23
and this is him and every how he goes
20:25
about his life but like he is perfect
20:27
for Philly like it is a perfect for
20:31
Philly
20:32
and he creates that like he made it
20:34
perfect yeah with who he is but yeah I
20:37
mean he was he was a walk-on yeah he
20:40
came from you know this humble normal
20:43
working class Cleveland Heights
20:45
Philadelphia
20:47
sixth round pick his brother I played
20:49
with I mean the whole family his brother
20:51
had you know I don't know when he's
20:52
drafted a second round bunch of people
20:54
passed him but he got kicked out of our
20:55
on off our football team like it is like
20:58
a little bit of a real life Rocky story
21:00
and
21:01
you know I don't I mean the film he's
21:04
happy with it it's weird for him having
21:06
a film be about him and his family so
21:08
you know when he talks about it it's
21:09
sort of putting but I can say
21:13
I like he's gonna get even more loved
21:16
here and if it's even possible like you
21:19
know what I mean it's it's people are
21:21
gonna love him even more I think I'm a
21:23
fair man with that guy yeah totally is
21:25
and then the out the Christmas album you
21:26
guys are working on a set part two right
21:28
Christmas album is done oh it's done
21:30
it's done it's locked it's getting
21:31
manufactured I'm way ahead we're way
21:33
ahead of it uh than we were last year
21:36
last year you know the
21:37
you know people that didn't get the the
21:39
record I apologize we've ordered a lot
21:42
more of this well we'll see rewarded a
21:44
lot more and
21:46
um they will go on sale
21:48
right after Halloween so people were
21:49
able to pre-order okay November 3rd is
21:52
the plan to put out the first single
21:55
um you can pre-order up until
21:56
Thanksgiving and then the online store
21:58

22:01
the idea is people don't care about this
22:03
but just you know vinyl takes a long
22:04
time to produce yeah that's why other
22:06
people do it anymore
22:07
um so we have to put in a number you
22:10
know so if you want to make sure you get
22:11
it early November put in your order
22:13
because people do care about that yeah
22:15
they want their hands on that thing it
22:17
was on the secondary what was it selling
22:18
for on the secondary Market it got a
22:20
little crazy for a bit there I think
22:22
there's still a couple grand for a
22:23
couple going for a couple thousand
22:24
dollars on eBay and stuff that's nuts
22:26
but that hey that speaks to Jason and
22:29
and is it Saint Jordan Jason Lane same
22:31
same group yep and then we got we
22:34

they still we still lose the Super Bowl
23:24

23:27

23:29

23:32

23:34

23:38
hurts watching the end of that game so
23:40
just prepare yourself for that all right
23:42
thanks Pat thanks I appreciate it yep
23:45
thanks



My name is Connor Bwin and this is my
0:02
Philly love story.
0:12
As a player, I remember some of the
0:14
great games, Sunday Night Football,
0:15
Monday Night Football. The two best
0:18
memories are NFC Championships and then
0:20
last year winning it and and you know
0:23
then ultimately going to the Super Bowl
0:24
and winning the Super Bowl um was really
0:26
special. Well, I'm special because, you
0:27
know, I'm there with my family on the
0:29
field, with all the players families,
0:31
with our, you know, other coaches
0:32
families, all the people that have
0:34
worked so hard to get there. Um,
0:37
celebrating and just the the pure joy of
0:39
it. And then the fans are still there.
0:41
So, it was like a big a victory for the
0:43
whole city. And to see my very young
0:46
kids understand how important it was uh
0:49
was very cool to see.
0:53
Make the World Better is a nonprofit
0:54
that we started in 2013 and our goal is
0:57
to partner with community to reimagine
1:00
and revitalize their public spaces. So,
1:03
I started Make the World Better when I
1:04
moved to Philadelphia in 2013 to play
1:06
for the Eagles. It was my fifth year in
1:09
the NFL and I had seen what other
1:12
players were doing around the league to
1:14
support their community. And when I
1:16
moved to Philadelphia, I decided I
1:18
wanted to do something and make an
1:19
impact. you know, growing up in the city
1:22
and spending so much time at the park
1:25
and in rec centers playing sports and
1:28
seeing the impact that sometimes only a
1:32
few individuals or a few adults can have
1:34
on a lot of kids in a small public
1:36
space. I knew that was something that I
1:38
wanted to be involved in and try and
1:40
create more of those safe, healthy
1:43
spaces for kids in Philadelphia. When I
1:45
see anybody enjoying these spaces, it
1:48
brings me joy. You know, that's what
1:50
parks I always say are supposed to be. A
1:51
place where you find joy for everybody.
1:53
For young kids to older kids to parents
1:57
to grandparents. Parks really at their
1:59
best are a magical place that bring
2:01
everyone together. You know, when you
2:03
think about kids, they need places to
2:05
play. They need places to
2:09
be independent. They need places to
2:11
learn how to deal with conflict, learn
2:13
how to be good teammates. They need
2:15
places to gain confidence. There's not
2:18
enough of those places in in most
2:21
cities. There's definitely not enough in
2:23
Philadelphia, but uh Philadelphia is
2:25
making, you know, big improvements in
2:27
their public space, and we hope we're
2:28
playing a small part in that.
2:30
Yes. Yes. Go birds.
2:33
For the last 10 years, we've been
2:34
hosting a benefit concert really to seed
2:38
uh funding for these parks. parks are,
2:41
you know, pretty uh expensive and uh,
2:44
you know, that's also comes from my love
2:47
of of music. Just like parks bring
2:49
people together, sports bring people
2:51
together, you know, the other one is
2:53
music brings people together.
2:54
This is the first time there's been
2:56
music in FDR Park in 31 years. The last
2:58
time
3:01
uh this year was really awesome. We're
3:02
able to bring the concert into the park.
3:06
Moving forward, we're working on trying
3:08
to bring more music back into the park
3:10
to bring more people together around
3:12
music to help fund future park projects
3:14
in the city.
3:17
I think my definition of love has grown
3:19
since moving to Philadelphia. I started
3:22
my family in Philadelphia. Uh got
3:24
married while I was living in
3:25
Philadelphia. Had two kids while I was
3:26
living in Philadelphia. I think I've
3:28
grown to love a lot more things um since
3:31
I' I've lived in Philadelphia. I never
3:33
I've always lived in Philadelphia. I
3:35
probably always will live in
3:36
Philadelphia. Um because it's the energy
3:39
that's in the city. It's not perfect.
3:41
There's issues at times. Um but I think
3:43
the benefits outweigh the cost for sure
3:46
when it comes to, you know, the energy,
3:49
the uniqueness of the people you get to
3:51
come across, the food, the music, the
3:53
opportunities to engage um with people
3:56
even in random situations. Those
3:59
wouldn't happen unless you put yourself
4:01
uh in an environment for it to happen.
4:03
And you know, I started in the city when
4:06
I got here, and I think I'll always be
4:07
here in the city.




everyone welcome to a very special edition of the overseas famous podcast I'm your host Kevin Owens we are joined
0:25
by an incredible group of people today we have former NFL player Connor barwin
0:31
and uh we have fitzanne Reed both are from CSG Venture group and they are
0:39
the proud owners are majority owners of an Italian basketball
0:45
team and I think that's just fantastic and we're going to get into that today so both welcome thank you so much for
0:50
joining us today thank you thanks for having us Kevin of course now
0:56
kind of going into the biggest thing which is the acquisition of your Club
1:03
can you tell us how this opportunity even came well first hold on because I want to get into a pen thing real quick
1:09
because my brother went to Penn played basketball pen and he was super salty about the Princeton thing like he was so
1:16
mad that Princeton was doing so well and I was like in my mind I'm always thinking well yes your arrival but
1:24
shouldn't you be proud of your conference like I always looked at it when if if my conference did some damage
1:29
in the NCAA tournament I was always like okay this is good I played against these guys all Year my brother was not having
1:36
it he was so mad that Princeton kept winning are you guys on that level of the Princeton pen rivalry are you guys
1:43
just like nah it's cool I'll say uh uh happy for Princeton uh
College Sports
1:50
it's great for the tournament um you know I would love for Penn to do great that would be good I you know went
1:57
to undergrad at University of Cincinnati so I I really root for the Bearcats I didn't make the tournament this year
2:03
um but I will say to your brother's point this doesn't happen for me in college sports but at least in the NFL
2:08
you know I still work for the Eagles and say the Cowboys or the Giants make the
2:14
playoffs I am definitely not rooting for them to assure you that
2:20
I I think when it gets to professional sports I think you're right on point I think that's something that you got I
2:26
would 100 agree you can't root for the eagle or for the uh Cowboys or the Giants you know playing for the Eagles
2:32
and currently working there yeah you just kind of hope that they flop because that would be the worst as a fan I think
2:39
that too I I hate I'm a huge Phillies fan so like the Mets Etc I just now Fitz
2:46
you are from New York so I don't want to start getting you know too much passing around New York you'll just start getting pissed off
Sports Fans
2:52
I'm a I'm a Giants fan I'm a Knicks fan I did root for the Eagles in Super Bowl only because of Connor only because of
2:58
loyalty to Connor that's it that's it so let's go into the obvious huge
3:05
acquisition you guys uh took over the Italian team and when you looked at that
3:11
how did this opportunity even come up to acquire a team like that it started at Wharton I mean a group of
The Idea
3:18
us from more in sitting around the table some former athletes and be thinking hey you know we will always want to be
3:24
involved in sports we don't play anymore but we want to be involved you know I'm a lawyer by trade but grew up playing soccer I used to coach soccer at a high
3:32
level and so you know I just have this affinity for sports and so for us we thought look we'll own a sports team
3:38
when we're older you know got a little more Capital but it happened faster than we thought I mean actually one of our
3:44
professors came through and said look there are teams abroad you don't have to just look at teams in the United States their teams are broad that are for sale
3:51
all the time in fact there's one right now in Italy a basketball team what do you think and you know it took us about
3:56
a year of due diligence and checking things out and taking trips to Italy and meeting the team and the owners before
4:01
we could make it happen but uh we were able to do it way faster than we ever thought we could
4:08
what made you guys choose Trieste like when you look at this particular team and you're looking around what was it
4:15
about this specific team that stood out to you guys as uh a place where you
4:20
could make some money and you know create some impact in the Italian basketball world
4:27
I would say the first thing that jumped out to me and Connor you could jump in is just that Jordan played there once right like you
4:33
Google it and the first thing that comes up is Jordan smashing the backboard like and I was like all right so there's a
4:39
history here there's something here like that's pretty cool right so that opens the door to the conversation and then
4:44
also just where it's located you got so many players coming to the NBA out of Central Europe
4:50
and Eastern Europe and Trio stays kind of two hours it's two hours East of Venice but right on the border Croatia
4:57
and so you got this this strong basketball culture that's building and happening and so we wanted to be in the
5:03
the you know very um customer that right like all this excitement's happening in that area we wanted to be a part of that
5:09
so that that initially attracted us to that area yeah I would just say Kevin for me you
5:15
know everything that that fits said but you know the city is really unique and the city is important I think
5:21
um we in the due diligence and my diligence talking around uh you know people in the NBA uh people know about
5:28
this team uh interesting it's sort of an historic franchise I mean there was a identity of the city with the team and
5:37
you know in American Sports that's that's what is so important
5:43
um you know and then where it's located I mean right next to Slovenian Croatia there's a hotbed at basketball uh and
5:49
again like you know basketball is sort of the most important thing in that town uh which really was the most important
5:55
thing to me like if you're going to be able to sort of modernize a club it's really hard to
6:01
you know sort of create new fans but they have this built-in history of fans and
6:08
hopefully we can go sort of serve those fans uh better than they have before and the last thing I think I think sort of
6:14
Italy in itself is is attractive uh I think the LBA is an attractive League
6:19
um you know you have to deal with relegation and promotion which is crazy especially from an ownership side but
6:25
from a from a fan side from a entertainment side it is fascinating I
6:30
mean we've sort of been in control of the team for you know three four months now and we have like we thought we were
6:37
going to be in the playoffs now we're sort of at the bottom of the league it is just week to week there are these
6:43
sort of uh crazy things that are happening and you know we want to find
6:48
ways to show more people about how entertaining sort of European basketball is and especially Italian basketball
6:56
it's funny you brought up the fans because the fans play such a big imp uh
7:01
part of that whole entire experience I know playing collegiately you add a ton
7:07
of fans at your game same with Cincinnati like a major college you always have a ton of fans and then I was
7:14
playing in like the G League and there was like 20 people there and I was like what the like what am I
7:20
doing here and then I went overseas in every single game that I was playing in
7:25
Europe in Australia was packed like packed to the gills and the fans were crazy they're yelling sometimes they're
7:32
throwing stuff on the court it was such an experience and such an incredible atmosphere but that's why you want to
7:38
play that's what the the games that you look at at you know the Serbian games partisan it's it's it's an atmosphere
7:45
it's a crazy thing so when you guys look at that is that like your fan base that
7:50
you talked about that rabbit fan base that they just want to be there every single time and you talked about how
7:56
important that was do you have those interactions with the fans were they almost show you their passion on a daily
8:02
basis I mean Connor you play for the Eagles for crisis I'm an Eagles fan I know what passion means because uh I
8:09
grew up in it so yeah well you know we've all been over there and sort of or sort of felt it and seen
Building a fan base
8:15
it um you know they have a huge supporter group that's there uh you know fitzger came home wrong I think we have
8:20
the fourth biggest arena in the LBA um you know it's almost 7 000 people and it's you know filled up with people it's
8:27
freaking awesome like if you're if you're gonna go play in the J League you know or you're gonna go play you know
8:33
for this team I mean this is a a fun environment uh to go watch a basketball game to go play a basketball game and
8:40
I'll just tell you personally like you know there's certain things and we might get into it you know about
8:45
European basketball or this club where we sort of from an investment we saw an opportunity for Value right where you
8:51
can sort of modernize certain things but to be honest with you there is great learnings that I want to take from what
8:58
they do at this club uh and and what they've done to build up this fan base you know there's certain things with you
9:05
know the songs and the chants and everything that happened at a you know trash day
9:10
basketball game that I would love to find a way to learn from and bring back
9:16
to the States you know I mean the Eagles have a ton of stuff but we're always looking for ways to sort of innovate and
9:22
steal kind of good practices and I think there's a lot to learn from you know what they're doing over interesting
9:27
specifically and across sort of European basketball I mean could you imagine going to a basketball game NBA game and seeing fans
Fan culture
9:35
shirts off drums out yelling and screaming and and even during the
9:41
halftime they singing they're clapping it's it's not something you think about when you think about basketball you
9:46
usually associate that with like soccer right in Europe but like that culture is very strong in basketball and like the
9:54
fans are like love this team through and through and they're there to support the team through and through and that
10:00
passion shows at every home game right and to the point where you know sometimes it gets testy when you go go
10:05
to your Rivals and then you gotta get you know police making sure that you know certain fan groups are not with each other sitting next to each other
10:11
those are things that we have to think about now it's not something that happens in in basketball in the US
10:16
no you you hit it on the head I mean the the fan base is so important I remember
10:22
I was in a game and I've never experienced this before and it was I
10:28
couldn't hear like it was so loud that my ears were ringing and I couldn't even like process the noise that was coming
10:35
in I think I turned the ball over and then my coach was yelling it was just all I heard was this man it's always his
10:40
mouth moving I was like I have no idea what's happening right now this all these I need a timeout or something I'm like I'm actually overwhelmed uh but
10:48
that's the fans and I think when you talk about bringing that home I think when you talk about like the NFL like
10:54
the NFL does the game a week and when you're overseas it's like a game a week
10:59
and I think that creates such a buzz soccer a game a week when you're playing in the NBA and there's there's 82 games
11:05
and you're sometimes playing three games a week it's like hard to get the fan base to get up for each one but when you
11:11
have that one a week that's that's their life I mean the Eagles it's like the tailgates the boom and when you're
11:17
overseas like that's the same thing that basketball game is your life that's your routine that's what you're gonna do on
11:23
those weekends and it's just fascinating the difference between overseas Sports
11:28
and you know domestic Sports it's crazy unless Connor said though it makes the games count more you know less games
Every game matters
11:35
mean every game every game matters every single match man you can't go through a losing streak because that really has an
11:42
impact on how the team is doing uh similar to NFL
11:47
yeah you nailed it NFL we say like every every sort of You Know series matters
11:53
every play matters you know for the last four months I've suddenly quickly realized every
12:00
possession matters over there you know it's and it's for you know to your point it's 40 minute games I mean it's all on
12:06
the line once a week a 40-minute basketball game I mean you know your players are gonna empty the tank so I think that's just for us
12:13
you know that's so entertaining you know and we want more you know for you like you played overseas and I played college
12:20
basketball I wasn't very good but I had a ton of teammates that played overseas and it's getting better but it's kind of
12:25
like they go overseas and then they're just see you later nobody know what happened uh and it's so awesome what
12:32
they're doing over there and it's high level basketball and I think for us at CSG and at dress today we want more
12:38
people to see that how competitive is how fun these games are how good these players are
12:43
um and then in in the same way like we're not going to compete at all with the NBA I don't think CSG you know
12:50
that's none of our plans but we sort of want to complement the NBA right whether you're a player whether you're a coach
12:55
whether you're an executive we want CSG to be a place where you can go get better and sort of jump the line uh you
13:04
know in the NBA and that's sort of what we want to create there as far as kind of people going from the US over there
13:09
to play or to work I think what kind of with your
13:14
experience uh as a you know former NFL player how does that translate you've obviously
13:21
been in locker rooms you've obviously been in big situations but it's a different sport how does that translate
13:27
to your new role uh working with uh trueste
Developing at a high level
13:33
well I don't know exactly what you mean by translate um but I think in my role of the Eagles
13:39
I work in development right so I work with all leaders like on the field getting better but then there's stuff we
13:45
sort of do off the field um and you know when I think about sort of developing at a very high level you
13:53
know in in sort of basketball I look at terrestrate as this incredible
13:58
opportunity you know because there's a lot of you know and I'm sure in basketball the
14:04
same way you're 22 to 26. there's a lot of guys that don't sort of make it in
14:10
the NFL because they're still developing during that time they just need a place to go for a couple years in the NFL we
14:16
don't have a built-in sort of Developmental League we have college football and then you're in and now we have bigger practice squads that is
14:22
really sort of my focus helping these guys for a couple years but there's a lot of guys that just needed more time
14:28
uh for us it's interesting I think this can be a place you know you're 23 years old but you're physically you're
14:34
mentally going to be a lot different when you're 25 26 and maybe you're ready then to go into the NBA and I think
14:40
trustee can be that uh you know players are really interested in sort of having sort of a global mindset I mean we we
14:47
offer that uh the game as a whole especially basketball is becoming more and more International so I think teams
14:54
especially Americans will appreciate somebody having sort of a Global Perspective Global scouting perspective
15:00
you know it's a plan it's a it's a place to go innovate and try things that maybe you know you don't have the luxury to do
15:06
in the NBA if you're an executive or a coach uh so I see it as a real sort of
15:11
Developmental space and opportunity uh while also being a place that wins uh
15:17
you know for the fans they're interested and plays at a very high level I look at the Imports the the American
15:23
players that come in is it I feel like as an American who
15:29
would be you know traveling overseas it would be a breath of fresh air if I knew
15:34
that part of our ownership were American because the language barriers the the
15:40
issues that you that you deal with you sometimes you feel very alone you feel
15:45
completely isolated there's nothing really there and the the struggles that you have you're dealing with them on
15:51
your own so having that American ownership is that something that you
15:56
think your your Imports are have you have they reached out to you have they have they come and talked to you in
16:03
situations just because they feel more comfortable talking to an American than maybe someone you know of Italian you
16:10
know some Italian owner there's definitely some of that when I was out there I mean all the American players
How did this happen
16:16
just like flocked to me just trying to talk to me about how did how did this happen where are you from you know
16:22
asking me about my time in New York and um growing up and playing sports there's just gonna be a natural connection there
16:27
when you're American and you have players who are overseas who miss their families right because a lot of their families are not able to travel as much
16:34
to go see them playing or watching them um you know on the computer screen so you know having that connection makes it
16:41
a huge difference uh for those players but I think it makes a difference for all players I mean even the Italian players have you know came to us and
16:48
just really interested in what we offer in connection to Sports in in the US and so I think across the board just having
16:55
that connection in the US knowing that we're coming in from abroad given that the global perspective and opportunity
17:00
to expand their personal brand and the team's brand everyone wants that everybody wants that
17:06
everybody wants to be you know on TV or having them work over presence and having people know who they are and and
17:12
you know increase their followers and all that so like we offer that opportunity yeah I would just pick up on what Fitz
17:19
says I think it's all the players I think Kevin we all know like in basketball too it's very much about in
17:26
all life it's about relationships I hope you know our players understand you know we have certain relationships in the US
17:32
uh that you know can be helpful for them but most of all in my experience you know kind of be on the other side as an
17:38
athlete and I played for some great teams uh some great owners but you know
17:43
I would say Jeffrey I've learned from just being around Jeffrey Laurie and the most important thing an owner can do is
17:50
really care about the players and them being successful and finding ways to sort of set them up for Success uh and I
17:57
think at CSG that is solely our purpose and we need to make sure like our players know we care about them you know
18:04
and want to you know set up sort of the infrastructure around that team to help them develop and get better and get
18:10
where they want to go um you know and I think I mean Kevin you can maybe speak to this I think previously like sort of
18:16
you know player Americans playing overseas it's it's traditionally maybe because of language or whatever it's
18:22
more transactional you know you can't there's you know wide open free agency or in and out you're in and out we want
18:27
it to be a little bit more um not as transactional where they know we care about them you know it's not a
18:33
whole new roster every single year but you know there's more you know long-term development happening
18:38
it's funny you said that I talked to a player who I played with uh in Estonia
18:44
and he's Estonian and we talked about the the how difficult it
18:51
is for an domestic player like an Italian player to play when every few
18:59
weeks there's a new American shuffling in and then shuffling out and then shuffling in and shuffling out and they
19:05
everyone it's just it seems like a very frustrating experience for them because they're trying to they're trying to win
19:10
I mean they have their that's their home and their legacy is going to be
19:17
made by how well they do how many championships I mean it's the same with us like if here we're sitting there
19:24
having Michael Jordan and LeBron arguments all the time and it's all comes down to championships like oh he
19:30
wasn't a killer so these guys are in the same boat they're trying to enhance their legacy and then we're they're
19:35
sitting there dealing with all this nonsense of just people coming in and out and things not fitting and that's
19:41
just a it's a tough thing and I always said guaranteed contracts and better recruiting would fix a lot of those
19:47
things so when I look at that I look at it as like wow this is speaking to you
19:52
guys is a breath of fresh air because I think that's something that is so necessary overseas where you have
19:58
ownership that's like listen this is going to happen take your time let's develop and get this player better
20:05
because I mean you give three games it's really tough to get a small sample but
20:10
there's been multiple times where you know three games and some of my teammates have been going I'm like what where are you going they're like yeah
20:17
we're out I'm like wow that's crazy it's like such a short leash over there yeah
20:24
go ahead Fitz that was a good that that was a good learning less like when we bought the team
Advice for players
20:30
um we realized you know a lot of these players on one of your contracts or you know one season contracts and we're like but wait a minute why why is that the
20:36
case like why is that the norm in this league you know like there's so much development that can happen when you
20:42
have a player for for uh more than one season right like that's the goal and so I think you're right on in terms of how
20:48
you think about developing and guarantee contracts those are the things that we're thinking about too as we try to develop this team and help Elevate the
20:54
entire league Kevin let me ask you what would be like your two pieces of advice like new
21:00
ownership you know none of us played overseas uh you know what do you think are the two sort of most important
21:06
things uh in the minds of players over there to be successful I think the biggest thing is when I was
21:14
overseas I we talk about like the the mental side and the support system that
21:20
exists it's a lot easier domestically to call your parents uh I know when I was in
21:26
college my parents would come to a half like 90 of my games because I went to Monmouth which was an hour and 15 minute
21:32
drive and that support system was there so if I was frustrated or pissed off that support support system was there it
21:39
was very very I I you felt it that you were so far away like you knew in your
21:45
mind you were so far away and that everything was was your support system your your your friends your family were
21:52
all gone and you felt like you had no one to really talk to that was something that I said would be so beneficial if if
22:01
there was I mean we're that's what we're trying to do now but like having a something where people can talk to or
22:07
talk at some of their issues or even like the mental blocks that you could can create foul shots things like that
22:13
it's real easy when I'm sitting when I was in the G league and I'm like I'm missing my foul shots and then you
22:20
have like the top NBA shoot coaches like here let's do this and you're just sitting there like cool but none of that
22:25
is available overseas and you're just left on your own and you're left in your own too like you don't really have a ton
22:30
of access to the gym like you go to practice and then it's like okay well there's a I don't know like a another
22:36
game going on in here so you can't really it was just so I guess like the the having people there in the
22:43
organization to help these players through these tough times and understanding that these athletes are
22:49
dealing with so much and they're putting their lives out there and they're traveling so far away and chasing their
22:56
dream and that kind of needs some support at times and some people can handle it trust me I there's times I I
23:02
just had to handle it but now I feel like athletes I mean like the transfer I think athletes are
23:09
less inclined to be able to handle situations like that these days and I
23:16
think that's important and just having that support system there for them and uh I think that would be a big thing and
23:23
like you're saying the contracts that was the toughest thing because I
23:29
understand it's tough to scout a player when you're watching just film like you've never seen them live and all of a
23:35
sudden this person's like here's your airline ticket come over and then you're like oh like he's
23:41
not what I thought he was going to be but how do you do that do you take the time and be like okay let's work on this
23:47
because he's good and he showed he's good let's work on this or is it like win now and that's what you guys were
23:54
saying it's like a very win-nail mentality because you only have a certain amount of games it's not a 82 Game season so that win now mentality so
24:01
like having something where there's a guaranteed one-year contract and it's not like shifting of players will help
24:07
the team will help the domestic players and will help those Imports establish themselves and not sit there with this
24:14
burden of like oh my God I had I had 12 points like I'm gonna get released and that's what I thought I had 12 points
24:20
one time and I was like um might as well just pack up my because I'm leaving I didn't end up doing it but I guess
24:26
they gave me another shot and then I ended up being an All-Star and it's like you never know it's like there's just
24:31
different things that happen so having that leniency having that guarantee and having that support for the players that
24:37
would be my biggest things
Support for players
24:42
those are great points and I think that's something we're talking a lot about at CSG right now is sort of the
24:49
the support sort of all the way around and just like thinking about how hard it is for you know some of these players to
24:55
be alone you know on the other side of the world that's tough that'd be tough for anybody
25:01
um and then put in the pressure that sort of the fans and the coaches and everybody puts on them oh my gosh we've
25:07
got a special guest here just found her way up here hi
25:13
um and then I would say to your point I thought I think this is important to say but when we did our due diligence
25:20
um you know Trieste and credit to all the staff there and the team and and the
25:25
owners that no one and we talk to players I talk to agents I talk to people around the NBA there has never
25:32
been a question about players not getting paid who have played for Trieste which we thought was really important to
25:38
not be you know purchasing a team that had sort of those credibility issues
25:44
um and trustee hasn't had that that's incredible that is a huge thing uh
25:50
I never really experienced it to the point where other other guys I always was everything was pretty stable where I
25:56
was Owen was a little weird uh they just kind of released all the Imports at one
26:01
time and were like okay I guess I'm leaving but it's just it's wild how some
26:07
teams just you know you make those accommodations and you make that investment but that you're not willing
26:12
that you don't have the funds to actually pay for that so that was that's that's kind of the Wild West now before
26:17
I wrap this up you guys uh biggest question is what would I uh for
26:24
both of you you have both done a tremendous job of taking on uh the the ownership of a sports team what what
26:32
advice would you give to someone who's looking to invest because I have I spend a lot of my times in meetings helping
26:38
with my clients who are overseas athletes but I've been spending more time with people who are investing and looking to invest in overseas basketball
26:46
and they always ask for advice and you know things that we just kind of talked
26:51
about now when you guys look at it what's a piece of advice that you guys would give to anyone looking to pursue a
26:58
career in sports management or ownership overseas you got to understand the fan base
Advice for investors
27:06
um you got to understand what they care about why are they passionate about this team understand the history of the team
27:11
because that goes a long way in terms of where you're going to bring the team how are you going to bring the team forward and how you're going to advance the team
27:17
given that the fans are so sensitive about their teams because it really represents who they are and where they're from even the smallest changes
27:24
that you can make can have a huge impact in that region so you got to really understand and like go out there and visit and shake hands I was talking to
27:31
our cab drivers I'm talking to you know person serving me coffee like tell me about this team like how have you how
27:37
long have you been in Trieste you gotta you really gotta be on the ground on some of this to really understand what you're about to get yourself into and
27:43
you also got to be a little you know you got to be a little crazy to invest in you know in sports overseas because it's
27:48
so different right it's such a different thing you got to be willing to to accept
27:53
the fact that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty you're not gonna know everything but you're taking the chance right and you're taking a chance on a
28:00
good group of people good group of players that have a huge prospects for the future and believe in that and be
28:06
steadfast in that even during the down times so it's hard you know it's not an easy thing to do but like we showed it's
28:12
possible yeah I would just I would just add
Final thoughts
28:18
they should they should do it keep learning as much as you can I mean for us right if somebody came to us and it's
28:23
just very simple advice but like they wanted to come help at CSG or work at CSG like become an expert at something
28:30
and come say hey we're an expert at this and we can help you at this so learn
28:35
everything you can about one one part of the game or part of the league or part of a team uh and then sort of bring that
28:42
to a sort of ownership group and say this is how you can add value the other thing is you know if you are investing
28:48
you know sort of at a whatever level I would say to fits point is you know
28:53
Sports is still I like to say sort of a business you know what I mean like it's a business that's for sure you know
28:59
you're in the entertainment business but it's different too you know it it represents people's identity
29:06
um you know it's really important to people there's a lot I mean Kevin you are a player you know what that's about
29:11
being a player um I just think you have to sort of be smart in how you think of it it's not
29:17
going to be transactional all the time you know you need to have a long-term vision of you know what you want to
29:23
invest in what kind of team you want to sort of support um I think that's really important because if you go in it just totally
29:29
transactional think you're going to make money you know in a three-year Horizon good luck you know I hope you do but
29:37
good luck I think you guys hit the uh a lot of people do the the who the what
29:42
the when the where the how even but not many people focus on the line Fitz you
29:48
really you that's exactly what I always look at like why are you doing this like
29:53
why what is your reasoning for doing this why are these people doing this
29:59
like you're talking to the to the different smaller aspects of the club but like why why are the fans the way
30:05
they are why are they and that's such a huge part of when I look at investing such a huge part you you have to focus
30:13
in on that why because that's the passion and when you focus in on that passion that's when it really comes
30:18
together and uh I was that was this is very interesting
30:23
because I love talking to athletes but I even love more talking to uh people who
30:29
are involved in other aspects of overseas Sports uh so this is a really a
30:34
pleasure for me uh so I really appreciate you guys both hopping on today
Outro
30:40
uh thank you for having us and if there's one message I would just say like these things are possible Right like if you're even thinking about
30:45
